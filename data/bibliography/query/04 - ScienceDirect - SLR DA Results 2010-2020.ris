AB  - As one of the most crucial concerns in hole cleaning and especially in directional drilling, cutting transport optimization eventuates in the reduction of drilling costs and increase in oil recovery. Cutting removal is, however, affected by different parameters including fluid flow rate, drill pipe rotation, cutting size and inclination which have to be considered simultaneously. In the current report, Liquid-Solid model is implemented to solve the governing equations in the Eulerian CFD framework. Results are compared with experimental data and successful validation with experimental data is achieved. On the basis of design of experiment algorithm, further simulations have been carried out to investigate the effect of the as mentioned key parameters on cutting transport behavior. Results show that hole inclinations between 45 and 60° are the most difficult angles in hole cleaning process. Moreover, increase in values of flow rate and drill pipe rotation will effectively improve the drag effects leading to superior cutting removal. Besides, it has been proven that cutting size affects cutting transport less than the other parameters. For industrial applications, an empirical correlation is developed for estimating cutting concentration. Buckingham-π theorem along with multi-variable regression technique is applied to establish the correlation.

AB  - In this study, yield strength of TaC-Fe composite on steel-based surface micro-nanostructure was studied by nano-indentation, finite element simulation, and dimensional analysis. Finite element analysis was utilized to simulate nano-indentation of TaC-Fe composite layer under different yield strengths, and equivalent stress cloud, equivalent strain cloud, and load–displacement curves with yield strengths of 6, 6.5, 7, and 7.5 GPa were obtained. Nano-indentation experimental result was analyzed with the Π theorem in dimensional analysis, and the relationship between load–displacement curve function and mechanical parameters, such as yield strength and Poisson's ratio of micro-nano-structured TaC-Fe composite layer, was obtained. The correctness of the dimensional analysis model and the reliability of finite element simulation nano-indentation were validated using the combination of dimension-function relationship, simulation calculations, and load-displacement curve obtained through nano-indentation experimentation. Yield strength of micro-nanostructured TaC-Fe composite layer was determined as 7.05 GPa.

T2  - Progress in Nuclear Energy
AB  - Containment vessel of nuclear power plant is the last barrier to prevent the leakage of radioactive materials, so the seismic performance is of high importance. In order to investigate the seismic performance of the CPR1000 prestressed concrete containment vessel (PCCV) structure under design and beyond-design basis earthquake, a 1/20 scale concrete containment vessel (CCV) model was designed and constructed on the shaking table based on the similitude requirements from the Buckingham's π-Theorem. The horizontal and vertical earthquake waves generated from RG1.60 spectrum were selected as the input earthquake waves in the shaking table model test, and the earthquake waves with peak ground acceleration (PGA) 0.2g, 0.3g, 0.4g, 0.5g, 0.7g, 0.9g and 1.2g respectively were loaded step by step until the macroscopic failure occurred in the model containment vessel. The dynamic responses of the model CCV were obtained from the acceleration sensors and resistance strain gages. The model test results showed that the maximum acceleration magnification factor of the model CCV was 1.974 with PGA of 0.2g, which indicated that the CCV had a good seismic-resistant behavior under 0.2g earthquake. Until the second last test case with the horizontal peak earthquake motion of 0.9g (corresponding to 0.9g for the prototype structure), the fundamental frequency of the model CCV only decreased slightly and the maximum tensile strains at all monitoring points were much smaller than the ultimate tensile strain. It meant that the model CCV as a whole was within the elastic range. In the last case (1.2g), the model fundamental frequency decreased steeply. At the same time, the maximum tensile strains at the heel of the cylinder wall far exceeded the ultimate tensile strain and a circle of cracks occurred at the cylinder wall heel. It meant rupture failure had occurred and the cylinder wall heel of the CCV was the weak region. It agreed well with the numerical analysis results and the visual inspection and camera record at the test site. Although a circle of concrete cracks appeared around the cylinder wall foot, the model CCV still remained integral as a whole and neither cracking parts dislocation nor collapse occurred. Because the test model was a plain concrete structure and the model test results should be conservative estimation, it can be concluded that the prototype PCCV for CPR1000 nuclear power plant had sufficient seismic safety margin.

AU  - Hanna, Steven
T2  - Atmospheric Environment
AB  - The Britter and McQuaid (B&M) 1988 Workbook for Dense Gas Modeling uses principles of basic physics and thermodynamics to develop simplified nomograms for calculating dense gas dispersion, involving dimensionless combinations of the fundamental variables and parameters. There is one nomogram for instantaneous releases, and another for continuous releases. The B&M nomograms were applied to the three Jack Rabbit II (JR II) chlorine release trials being used for the multi-model comparison described in other papers in this special issue. The intent was to use the B&M model as a baseline against which other, more sophisticated models, could be compared. In any model applied to the JR II trials, it is important to properly initialize the cloud characteristics (geometry, density, etc.). The B&M handbook has a simple basic thermodynamics method to calculate the initial size and density of a cloud released as a two-phase pure mixture. It is shown that the B&M nomograms’ predictions of arc maximum concentration (arc max C) for JR II trials 1, 6, and 7 have skill about in the middle of the group of 17 models that are being compared. The B&M predictions are relatively unbiased for Trials 6 and 7 (which has the largest arc max C), but overpredict by a factor of 2 or 3 for Trial 1. It is concluded that the B&M nomograms are conservative and are adequate for first-cut estimates of maximum concentrations following large scale dense gas releases.

T2  - Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science
AB  - Floating intake is an effective facility of selective withdrawal to regulate the outflow temperature from thermally stratified reservoirs. The outflow temperature was the result of the interaction among temperature field, flow field and artificial regulation. To characterize them, three influencing factors (i.e., temperature distribution, outflow rate and submerged depth) were chosen. Experiments were conducted to investigate the response of outflow temperature to influencing factors in a nonlinearly stratified fluid with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Results showed that the withdrawal layer was formed near the level of floating intake inhibited by the density gradient, and its thickness was proportional to stratification intensity. The withdrawal layer ascended with the decrease in submerged depth, and the thickness also changed due to the variation in density gradient. Although the outflow temperature increased, the variation amplitude depended on the temperature gradient between the two submerged depths. However, enlarging the outflow rate within a certain range had relatively small influence on the withdrawal layer thickness and the outflow temperature. Considering the experimental results, a formula was developed for predicting the outflow temperature based on dimensional analysis and energy conservation.

AB  - Draft tube is the part of Francis turbines which is used to both discharge water and recover kinetic energy at the exit of the runner. A design optimization study of an elbow type draft tube based on the combined use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), design of experiments, surrogate models and multi-objective optimization is presented in this study. The geometric variables that specify the shape of the draft tube are chosen as input variables for surrogate models and the pressure recovery factor and the head loss are selected as output responses. It is determined that, pressure recovery factor, which is the main performance parameter, can be increased by 4.3%, and head loss can be reduced by %20 compared to the initial CFD aided design. Pressure recovery factor, is represented with a second order polynomial regression model in terms of the geometrical parameters based on the optimization results. The verification of the model is also provided by comparison with CFD results for different draft tubes other than that are used in the development of the model. The model is verified using 30 different design points and it can predict the pressure recovery factor with an error of less than 8%. This model allows the fast and correct design and optimization of elbow type draft tubes, without the need for further CFD simulations.

T2  - Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
AB  - Photovoltaic–thermal (PV/T) collectors provide renewable energy, and they are instrumental to achieve grid independency. A subset of these collectors is collectors that are integrated into building envelope. The so-called “building-integrated” PV/T collectors have seen a dramatic rise in popularity recently. This recent popularity has necessitated systematic design optimization. To benefit design optimization, a review of computer models of these collectors was performed. This review was performed by objectively assessing international findings on roof-integrated and curtain-wall integrated PV/T collectors. The scope of this review was thermal collection efficiency. The significance of this review was to identify the weakest link in computer models that should one day lead to more accurate computer models. This weak link is the internal heat transfer rate. To overcome this weakness, a model calibration method was proposed that is based on case-by-case parameter identification. In addition, a detailed dimensional analysis was performed that allowed a new Π group to be introduced to Nusselt (Nu) number correlations of developing, turbulent parallel-plate flow. This Π group is the Stanton number as applied to the inter-channel radiative heat transfer coefficient (Str). Commonly implemented Nu number correlations do not account for this heat transfer rate. They only account for collector geometry, collector air flow inertia and collector air viscosity.

AB  - Highly curved helical pipes offer attracting potentialities for intensified mass/heat transfer performances as they generate intense Dean-type vortices. The evaluation of friction factor in such geometries is necessary for assessing the trade-offs between the increase of transfer efficiency and the associated specific energy requirement. Unfortunately, such data are lacking for highly curved helixes, probably due to the difficulty to manufacture these geometries through traditional manufacturing techniques. In this paper, CFD simulations are carried out for determining the laminar flow friction factor in helical pipes, particularly highly curved ones. For an experimental validation of the numerical results, a highly curved helix was built by 3D-printing. Existing correlations are shown to fail for the accurate prediction of the friction factor in highly curved helixes. A new correlation is thus proposed. An excellent agreement is obtained between the experimental pressure drop measurements and the proposed correlation predictions.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a new heat-transfer correlation for the flow of SuperCritical Water (SCW) in bare circular tubes, and its applicability to thermalhydraulic analysis for Heat eXchanger (HX) designs, linking a SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactor (SCWR) and a Copper-Chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycle-based hydrogen co-generation facility. A large set of experimental data, obtained in SCW flowing upwards in a 4-m long vertical bare tube with a 10-mm Internal Diameter (ID), was analyzed. The data were collected at pressures of about 24 MPa, inlet temperatures from 320 to 350 °C, values of mass flux ranging from 200 to 1500 kg/m2·s and heat fluxes up to 1250 kW/m2, for several combinations of wall and bulk-fluid temperatures that were below, at, or above the pseudocritical temperature. A dimensional analysis was conducted, using the Buckingham Π-theorem, to derive a general form of the empirical SCW heat-transfer correlation for the Nusselt number, which was finalized based on the experimental data obtained within the Normal Heat-Transfer (NHT) and Improved Heat-Transfer (IHT) regimes. The derived correlation showed the best fit for the experimental data within a wide range of flow conditions. This correlation has an uncertainty of about ±25% for Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) values and approximately ±15% for calculated wall temperatures. Subsequently, this correlation was used to calculate HTCs in support of preliminary thermalhydraulic calculations for HXs with SCW and SuperHeated Steam (SHS) as the operating fluids. The HXs are to be designed for integration into the No-Reheat or Single Reheat SCW Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) cycles and provide a link to support hydrogen production through the Cu–Cl cycle. Thermal energy will be transferred from the SCWR to an intermediate SHS loop operating at 5 MPa and delivered to the hydrolysis and oxygen-production process steps of the Cu–Cl cycle facility, which operates at temperatures of up to 530 °C. The analyzed HXs are of a double-pipe, counter-flow design. Calculations involved numerical solutions to identify HX outlet flow temperatures, required pipe lengths, number of pipes for each HX unit, mass flow rates and other relevant heat transfer parameters. Various test conditions have been assessed in support of a database to determine feasible configurations for an HX design.

T2  - STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF SOIL AND SOIL COVER IN A CHANGING WORLD: CHARACTERIZATION AND SCALING
AB  - Scale is recognized as a central concept in the description of the hierarchical organization of our world. Pressing environmental and societal problems require an understanding of how processes operate at different scales, and how they can be linked across scales. Soil science as many other disciplines obtain the bulk of their empirical information at fine scales, whereas results of environmental diagnostics, monitoring, and predictions are needed to make important policy decisions at much larger scales. It becomes imperative to relate the information that is available and produced at different scales. The objective of this work is to present an overview of concepts that are currently used to define and relate scales in soil studies. The paper is not intended to be a compendium, but rather should be viewed as material for discussion, reference, and critique. It discusses definitions and terminology, including general approaches of scale problems in environmental studies that are applicable to soils, including hierarchies, measurement metrics, similitude, non-geometric scale metrics, and notions of upscaling and downscaling. Concepts of general scaling methods and theories are dimensional analysis, power law scaling, space and time dependent scaling. A section on spatiotemporal patterns introduces scaling ideas that were used in soil studies such as empirical orthogonal functions, data assimilation, and cumulative distribution function matching. Reviewed scaling methods developed specifically to soil studies include geometric similitude of pore spaces, scaling with Richards equation, scale dependencies of water and solute flux model parameters, scaling based on temporal stability, overland flow and sediment transport as the scaling phenomenon, and the relevance of scaling to pedotransfer functions. An outlook for scaling research in soils is presented that shows the needs of additional research and the feasibility of using scaling to enrich and advance soil research to help face the grand challenges of modern times.

T2  - Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science
AB  - According to Kyoto protocol R134a must be phased out soon due to its high global warming potential of 1430. In this work, an experimental investigation has made with R134a and LPG refrigerant mixture (composed of R134a and LPG in the ratio of 28:72 by weight) as an alternative to R134a in a vapor compression refrigeration system. Performance tests performed under different evaporator and condenser temperatures with controlled ambient conditions. The results showed that the R134a and LPG refrigerant mixture has higher values of coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency as compared to R134a by about 10.57–15.28% and 6.60–11.40%, respectively. The applicability of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict COP, Total Exergy destruction and Exergy efficiency of R134a/LPG system also investigated. For this aim, some of the experimental data utilized for training, an ANFIS model for the system developed. The ANFIS predictions agreed well with the experimental results with an absolute fraction of variance (R2) in the range of 0.994–0.998, a root mean square error (RMSE) in the range of 0.0018–0.1907 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the range of 0.103–0.897%. The results suggest that the ANFIS approach can be used successfully for predicting the performance of vapor compression refrigeration systems.

The variables that describe the structure in terms of dynamic were determined and pi groups were created by using the Buckingham Pi Theorem. A finite element model that is able to calculate the natural frequencies, mass participation factors, and draw the mode shapes of a structure composed of space frame elements was developed. The mast was scaled down to use in the laboratory environment with two different scale factors as 30 and 40. The most suitable model which represents the dynamic behavior of the real-size tower crane mast for the experimental studies was determined by comparing the modal analysis results of the real-size and scale models.

AU  - Oliver, Todd A.

T2  - International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer
AB  - Shaped-hole film cooling is an essential cooling technology in modern gas turbine engines. The performance of a given film cooling design, and thus the life of the cooled part, is dependent on the scenario parameters that define the environment in which it operates, including Reynolds and Mach numbers, upstream boundary layer and turbulence characteristics, blowing ratio, density ratio, pressure gradient, surface curvature, etc. Of these, one parameter that has received relatively little attention in the open literature is Mach number. This work evaluates the role of Mach number in shaped-hole film cooling performance by comparing results of two large eddy simulations of a plenum-fed 7-7-7 hole cooling a flat plate at freestream Mach numbers of 0.25 and 0.5, with all other relevant scenario parameters fixed. This comparison shows important differences between the two cases. To begin, the performance, as measured by laterally-averaged adiabatic effectiveness, is dramatically different, with the high Mach case performing up to 50% worse. This decrease in performance at high Mach is due to the coolant jet separating from the surface and a large scale oscillation that leads to significant asymmetry in the time-averaged flow, features which are absent in the low Mach case. These changes appear to be caused by changes to the flow in the cooling hole, which is also asymmetric in the high Mach case. This asymmetry leads to entrainment of hot gas into the hole on one side. Further, in the high Mach case, the flow in the hole is mildly supersonic and has sequence of weak shocks, which are, of course, absent in the low Mach scenario.

AB  - Insufficient cleaning in the food industry can create serious hygienic risks. However, when attempting to avoid these risks, food-processing plants frequently tend to clean for too long, at extremely high temperatures, or with too many chemicals, resulting in high cleaning costs and severe environmental impacts. Therefore, the optimization of cleaning processes in the food industry has significant economic and ecological potential. Unfortunately, in-situ assessments of cleaning processes are difficult, and the multitude of different cleaning situations complicates the definition of a comprehensive approach. In this study, two methodological approaches for the comprehensive modeling of cleaning processes are introduced. The resulting models facilitate comparisons of different cleaning processes and they can be scaled up for processes with similar conditions, using cleaning time as a response. A dimensional analysis is performed to obtain general results and to allow transfer of the approaches to other cleaning situations. The models are established according to the statistical rules for the deduction of multiple regression equations for the prediction of the response based on the input parameters. The terms of the model equation are confirmed with a significance analysis. A machine learning approach is also used to create model equations with symbolic regression. Both methods and the obtained model equations are validated. The two applied approaches reveal similar significant terms and models. Significant dimensionless numbers are the Reynolds number, the density number that describes the ratio of the density of the soil to the density of the cleaning agent, and the soil number, which is a new dimensionless number that characterizes the properties of food soils. The methodology of both approaches is transparent; therefore, the resulting equations can be compared and similarities are found. Both methods are deemed applicable for the computational modeling of cleaning processes in food industry.

AB  - Suitable design and management of drip irrigation systems depends on an accurate knowledge of the moisture distribution patterns around the emitters. An important parameter in the design of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems is the wetted pattern of soil area in the up and down wetted areas of drippers. Accurate estimation of the up and down wetted areas in surface/subsurface irrigation systems is essential for enhancing the efficiency of irrigation systems and optimal management of water resources in the field. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) and nonlinear regression (NLR) methods were used to develop equations for the estimation of the up and down wetted areas around the dripper installation position. Experiments were carried out in a transparent physical Plexiglas with dimensions of 3m×1.22m×0.5m. In this study, three different soil textures (i.e., light, medium, and heavy) were used. The drippers at four installation depths, including 0, 15, 30, and 45 cm, were evaluated. By considering an irrigation time equal to 6 h, the emitter discharge rates (i.e., 2.4, 4, and 6 L/s) were applied. Nine different variables, including soil hydraulic conductivity, emitter discharge, soil apparent density, irrigation application time, dripper installation depth, and the soil texture (i.e. amount of clay, silt and sand)were applied as inputs for the developed NLR and ANN models for estimating the up and down wetted areas of drippers. The comparison results between the measured and simulated values showed that the ANN and NLR models have appropriate performances and that the statistical error indices are within an acceptable range. The use of these models for design goals can be helpful in choosing the accurate distance between laterals and emitters as well as the suitable depth of emitters to minimize water losses via deep percolation in surface/subsurface drip irrigation. Furthermore, the results of the ANN and NLR models were compared with an experimental model (developed based on dimensional analysis (DA)) and confirmed the superiority of the ANN and NLR to DA models.

TI  - Development of a mathematical model to predict clean water head losses in hydrocyclone filters in drip irrigation systems using dimensional analysis

AU  - Demir, V.

T2  - Biosystems Engineering
AB  - A model was developed using dimensional analysis, to predict head losses in hydrocyclone filters. Different hydrocyclone filters with different specifications were used to measure head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. The parameters influencing head losses were considered to be the inside diameters of the inlet and outlet pipes, cylindrical section diameter of the filter, apex diameter of the conical part, cylindrical section length of the filter, conical section length of the filter body, length of the outlet (vortex finder) pipe, water velocity in inlet pipe, acceleration of gravity, kinematic viscosity of water. A dimensional analysis was carried out, using Buckingham's pi-theorem. To develop a model, experimental head loss data from 21 filters were considered in the study. The model accounted for 96.7% of the variation in the pressure coefficient. The predicted and the measured head losses were in close agreement with a correlation coefficient of 98.1%. The results showed that the model may be used to determine head losses in hydrocyclone filters with an acceptable accuracy if the variables are within the following ranges: inside diameter of inlet and outlet pipe 0.053–0.154m; cylindrical section diameter of the filter 0.195–0.46m; apex diameter of the conical part 0.04–0.06m; cylindrical section length of the filter 0.16–0.41m; conical section length of the filter body 0.37–0.955m; length of the vortex finder pipe 0.155–0.627m; flow rate 3.7–98.48m3h−1; and Reynolds number 18 860–421 065. The performance of the model was compared with models developed for industrial hydrocyclones and the necessary comparisons were established by using statistical test procedures. The model in this study provides better predictions as compared to some other models available in the literature.

AB  - Experiments have been carried out in a 0.1m internal diameter, 1.88m height vertical Plexiglas column with an antenna type modified air sparger in the gas–liquid distributor section. This arrangement provides uniform mixing of the fluids, ensures the gas entering the fluidizing section as fine bubbles and reduces the pressure drop encountered through a conventional distributor used for the purpose. The important dimensionless groups which have influence on the gas holdup have been developed by the use of Buckingham Pi theorem. The relation of gas holdup with these dimensionless groups has been expressed in the form of a power law equation developed with very high correlation coefficient. Residual analysis has been carried out to validate the regression model. The optimum operating conditions for maximum gas holdup in a co-current three-phase fluidized bed have been predicted using genetic algorithm.

AB  - The hydraulic performance of thin-wall lay-flat polyethylene pipes with non-coaxial emitters were evaluated in this study. Two experiments were performed to measure the dimensional variation of commercially available lay-flat drip irrigation pipes. A model for estimating the corresponding local head loss was developed and validated using dimensional analysis. The model was then implemented in a finite element algorithm to analyse the hydraulic performance of this type of pipes. Finally, a design example was provided. The results revealed that, for a wall thickness of 0.13 and 0.20 mm, the pipe height and width tended to be equal above a relatively low pressure, and the pipe cross-section rapidly inflated from a quasi-rectangular form to circular. For thicker walls, the equivalent diameter (four times the hydraulic radius) increased continuously with increasing pressure head but it hardly reached its nominal diameter (16 mm). The proposed model indicated that the local head loss was affected by the equivalent diameter, emitter geometry, and flow velocity. The model had high accuracy in determining the local head loss. The estimated results were in close agreement with the measured data. According to the numerical simulation, the ratio of local head loss to total loss along a pipe was up to 74.71%. The design results, when using an earlier model, demonstrated a longer maximum lateral length, since the model did not consider further contraction of the flow caused by pipe deformation. However, the model proposed here could be used in the design of systems for thin-wall lay-flat polyethylene pipes.

T2  - Thin-Walled Structures
AB  - The investigation leading to the present study is motivated by the fact that dimensional analysis, as well as empirical modelling, are valuable methods for scholars to find the relationships between effective parameters in every process. By suggesting new dimensionless numbers based on the dimensionless governing equations and using a new mathematical method, namely, singular value decomposition method, significant improvements have been made in preparing a wide range predictions of maximum permanent transverse deflections of thin quadrangular metallic plates due to impulsive loads, especially, gas mixture detonation loading. The dimensionless numbers are based on important and effective parameters such as inertia of applied loads, mechanical properties of materials, structural geometry and strain rate sensitivity. The accuracy and benefits of present empirical models have been investigated by validating the obtained results with gas mixture detonation loading experiments and those in the literature for impulsively loaded plates. Experimental data have been obtained by single staged gas detonation apparatus for aluminum alloy and mild steel plates with different thicknesses. A comparative study revealed that when the material coefficients in Cowper-Symonds constitutive equation have been considered as functions of plate thickness, the present empirical models predict the ratio of midpoint deflection to the thickness more accurately than well-known Jones’ theoretical equation.

AB  - Accurate and efficient tire models for deformable terrain operations are essential for performing vehicle simulations. A direct application of an on-road tire model to simulate tire behavior on a deformable terrain such as soft soil is not possible. The methods for modeling and evaluation of performance of the wheeled vehicles on deformable terrains are influenced by different terrain properties in addition to design and operational parameters. These methods are ranged from very simple empirical methods to highly complex finite element methods. This survey covers the most used models that have been developed for wheeled vehicles in off-road applications. The emphasize is on the models that have made a significant contribution in advancement of techniques for characterizing soil, tire, soil–tire interaction, experimental analysis, model parameterization and model validation. A description is given for selected studies to familiarize the reader with the general terminologies, formulations and modeling approaches. More importantly, two summary tables are given for three groups of models in which the overall features of each model are reviewed and compared to other models. These tables can be used to understand the general picture of the available techniques, and facilitate selecting the appropriate model for future applications.

T2  - Food Control
AB  - A better understanding of protein fouling during the thermal treatment of whey protein concentrate (WPC) solutions is critical for better fouling control. In order to understand the impact of various parameters on the total whey protein fouling mass, a dimensional analysis was applied to the experimental data obtained from a pilot scale plate heat exchanger, setting total fouling mass as the target variable. A model was developed to predict the total fouling mass, covering a series of variables including whey protein solution concentration (2.5–25 g/L), calcium concentration (70-120 ppm), running time (90-330 min), fouling solution flow rate (200-500 L/h), total fouling surface area, outlet temperature (82-97 °C) and differences in whey protein concentrate powders. In addition to temperature dimensionless parameters, the main parameters involved in the model are the Reynolds number (2000-5000) and the calcium to β-lactoglobulin molar ratio (2.7–34.7). The model developed concerns only pure whey proteins solutions since all the testing solutions were casein free. This model has allowed us to provide guidelines as to how the above parameters influence fouling within the plate heat exchanger, as well as empirical correlations for predicting such fouling development.

AB  - In this work, an energy analysis of vapor compression refrigeration system (VCRS) using R134a and LPG refrigerant mixture as an alternative to R134a is carried out. Performance tests were performed with different evaporator and condenser temperatures under controlled ambient conditions. The results showed that R134a and LPG refrigerant mixture has higher coefficient of performance than R134a by about 15.1–17.82%. Mathematical and ANFIS models validated by experimental data were developed to predict the energetic performance of VCRS. It was found that mathematical and ANFIS models predictions agreed well with experimental results and brought out the absolute fraction of variance in range of (0.9253–0.9567 and 0.9953–0.9961), root mean square error in range of (0.0167–7.688 and 0.0018–1.025) and mean absolute percentage error in range of (0.606–2.243 % and 0.103–0.362 %) respectively. The results suggest that ANFIS models show better statistical prediction efficiency.

AU  - Zhao, Bingtao

AU  - Tao, Wenwen
T2  - Applied Energy
AB  - Rotating packed beds have been demonstrated to be able to intensify the physicochemical process of multiphase transportation and reaction in the fields of energy and environment, and successfully applied in the field of CO2 emission control. However, modeling and prediction of gas–liquid mass transfer especially for mass transfer with chemical reaction are rare due to the complexity of multiphase fluid flow and transportation. In view of the inaccuracy of semi-empirical models and the complexity of computational fluid dynamics models, an intelligent correlation model was developed in this work to predict the mass transfer coefficient more accurately for CO2 capture with NaOH solution in different type rotating packed beds. This model used dimensional analysis to determine the independent variables affecting the mass transfer coefficients, and then used least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) for prediction. An optimized radial basis function was obtained as kernel function based on grid search coupled with simulated annealing (SA) and 10-fold cross-validation (CV) algorithms. The proposed model had the mean square error of 0.0016 for training set and 0.0012 for testing set. Compared with the models based on multiple nonlinear regression (MNR) and artificial neural network (ANN), the present model decreased mean squared error by 91.06% and 38.46% for training set and 94.57% and 53.85% for testing set respectively, suggesting it had superior performance on prediction accuracy and generalization ability.

AB  - This paper presents a computational study into the static aeroelastic response of a 2D wind turbine airfoil under varying wind conditions. An efficient and accurate code that couples the X-Foil software for computation of airfoil aerodynamics and the MATLAB PDE toolbox for computation of the airfoil deformation is developed for the aero-elastic computations. The code is validated qualitatively against computational results in literature. The impact of a flexibility of the airfoil is studied for a range of design parameters including the free stream velocity, pitch angle, airfoil thickness, and airfoil camber. Static aero-elastic effects have the potential to improve lift and the lift over drag ratio at off-design wind speed conditions. Flexibility delays stall to a large pitch angle, increasing the operating range of a flexible blade airfoil. With increased thickness the airfoil deformation decrease only linearly.

AB  - Distributed defects in rolling element bearing arise due to the progression of small localized pits. If not monitored on time, this leads to premature or may turn into catastrophic failure of a rotor system and thus increases the cost of maintenance of machinery in industries. This research work introduced a novel method for the diagnosis of rolling element bearings to detect distributed defects using Dimensional Analysis (DA). The rolling element bearing system is modeled using DA with Buckingham’s theorem to study the vibration characteristics theoretically. Significant geometrical and response parameters are considered for modeling the rotor-bearing system. The in-house experimental test rig is designed and fabricated to study the vibration characteristics of distributed defects experimentally. Geometrical imperfections are created intentionally on the bearings surfaces using electro-discharge machining and vibration signatures generated are studied under different operating conditions. Experimental results are compared with analytical models developed using the DA. A comparison is made between distributed and localized defects and vibrations signatures from both are correlated with healthy bearings. It is noticed that there is a good correlation between theoretical and experimental results. The present study contributes as a simple and effective diagnosis of rolling element bearings for distributed defects and useful for condition monitoring of industrial machinery.

AB  - Spiral coils are investigated for flow of petroleum base oils SN70, SN150 and SN300 under isothermal steady state and a combination of isothermal steady state & non-isothermal unsteady state conditions for “Graetz problem”. The experiments were conducted with spiral coils with curvature ratios 0.01568, 0.01778, 0.019, 0.02466, 0.02525, 0.02666, 0.028055, 0.02952, 0.03011, under laminar flow condition. A new dimensionless number R′ number is introduced which is proved by the method of dimensionless analysis. The Nusselt number is correlated with R′ number for Newtonian fluids based on the experimental data. A number of correlations are developed for Newtonian fluids under isothermal steady state (total 130 tests) and a combination of isothermal steady state & non-isothermal unsteady state conditions (total 154 tests). It is found that R′ number characterizes the heat transfer phenomenon very well and it also simplifies the correlations on curved coils. The developed correlations are compared with the correlations developed by earlier investigators and are found to be in good agreement. These correlations can be used for the design of spiral coil heat exchangers.

T2  - Biosystems Engineering
AB  - Accurate hydraulic design of laterals is one of the most important factors for ensuring water distribution uniformity in drip irrigation systems. In order to keep water distribution uniformity at an appropriate value, pressure and flow rate variations of emitters along a lateral should be within acceptable limits. This makes the determination of the optimum lateral lengths for drip irrigation systems necessary. The objective of this study was to develop a simplified empirical model able to predict the optimum lateral length to obtain uniform water distribution. The model developed is valid for a 16 mm nominal pipe diameter, with cylindrical co-extruded emitters and emitter spacing ranging from 0.2 m to 1 m. Optimum lateral length data was obtained from 26 different drip irrigation pipes. The model developed accounted for 98.3% of the variation in the optimum lateral lengths. The model was obtained by considering pipes with inside diameters ranging from 12.3 to 14.2 mm, emitter inside diameters ranging from 11.5 to 12.6 mm, emitter lengths ranging from 31.6 to 68.2 mm, emitter spacing ranging between 0.2 and 1.0 m, emitter discharges ranging from 1.75 to 4.30 l h−1, and emitter flow variations from 10 % to 20 %, with gradients extending downhill or uphill <3%. The errors in the optimum lateral lengths increased with 3% downhill gradients for 0.75 and 1.0 m emitter spacing. The prediction model can be used to calculate the optimum lateral lengths without using any software.

T2  - Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science
AB  - In this study, we experimentally investigate the large-scale vortex pair formed by droplets in the spanwise direction of the flow field of a hollow cone spray injected transversely into a gaseous crossflow. Experiments are conducted in a square channel for a wide range of spray and crossflow conditions. The spatial and velocity distributions of the spray droplets for different cross-sections of the flow field in terms of different flow conditions are measured through flow visualization. Three parameters, namely, vortex vorticity, depth of vortex core, and distance between both vortex cores, are used to characterize the counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) formed by droplets. The crossflow Reynolds number, (initial atomized) droplet Reynolds number, and number of droplets injected per unit time are all found to significantly influence the features of droplets CVP. We newly define the spray-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio (J∗) based on the injected momentum flux of initial atomized droplets. Accordingly, we develop a set of correlations for predicting the features of droplets CVP based on experimental measurements and the Buckingham π theorem. The results show that these correlations well predict all measured conditions. The results of this study should provide insights into the dynamics of spray droplets in a crossflow and an understanding of the large-scale mixing between a hollow cone spray and a crossflow.

AB  - Elastomers have been extensively exploited to study cell physiology in fields such as mechanobiology, however, their intrinsic high hydrophobicity renders their surfaces incompatible for prolonged cell adhesion and proliferation. Electrospun fiber networks on the other side provide a promising environment for enhanced cell adhesion and growth due to their architecture closely mimicking the structure of the extracellular matrix present within tissues of the human body. Here, we explored the stable integration of electrospun fibers onto the surfaces of elastomeric materials to promote cytocompatibility of these composites. Elastomers based on room temperature vulcanizing silicone (RTV), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as well as functionalized PDMS-based materials were chosen as wafer substrates for attachment of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDFhfp) fibers, a well-known antithrombotic polymer. Electrospinning the fibers onto uncured interfaces acted as bonding agents on the wafers, enabling penetration and formation of a stable bond between the fibers surfaces and the elastomers after curing the interface. Dimensional analysis revealed a relationship between peeling force, intrusion depth and the elastic modulus of the wafers. A design parameter Πα was extrapolated to be used as a predictive tool of the peeling force when intrusion depth of PVDFhfp fibers and elastic modulus of the wafers are known. Cultivating fibroblasts on these hybrid membranes showed cell attachment and growth over 7 days regardless of the composition of the substrate, confirming high cytocompatibility for all composite materials. The presented approach opens avenues to establish nanofiber morphologies as a novel, stable surface texturing tool for tissue engineering, cell biology, medical devices and textiles.

AB  - The flow instability of hydrocarbon fuel is an important factor in the design of a regenerative cooling channel due to flow excursion accidents. To explore the mechanism of the instability process, the onset of flow instability (OFI) of cyclohexane were investigated experimentally in horizontal tubes at supercritical pressures. The geometric structure of the test channel, with a tube length of 0.20–0.79 m and inside diameter of 1.0–2.0 mm, was studied with regard to static flow characteristics. Based on the experimental data, a dimensionless analysis was conducted, and a new correlation to predict the OFI for supercritical fluids was obtained.

T2  - International Journal of Multiphase Flow
AB  - The study of thermal radiation interacting with particle-laden turbulence is of great importance in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. The fundamental and applied study of such systems is challenging as a result of the large number of thermo-fluid mechanisms governing the underlying physics. This complexity is significantly reduced by transforming the problem of interest into its scale-free form by means of dimensional analysis techniques. However, the theoretical framework of classical dimensional analysis presents the limitations of not providing a unique set of dimensionless groups, and no support for measuring the relative importance between them. In the interest of addressing these shortfalls for multiphysics turbulent flow applications, we present a semi-empirical dimensional analysis approach to efficiently extract important dimensionless groups from data obtained by means of computational (or laboratory) experiments. The methodology presented is then used to characterize important dimensionless groups in irradiated particle-laden turbulence. The study concludes that two dimensionless groups are responsible for most of the variation in the system’s thermal response, with the absorption of radiation by particles, the radiative energy deposition rate and the turbulent flow mixing the most important thermo-fluid mechanisms. The generality of the results obtained can be leveraged to effectively reduce the dimensionality of irradiated particle-laden turbulent flows in research studies and in the design and optimization of similar systems.

AB  - The solution to many engineering problems is obtained through the combination of analytical, computational and experimental methods. In many cases, cost or size constraints limit testing of full-scale articles. Similitude allows observations made in the laboratory to be used to extrapolate the behavior to full-scale system by establishing relationships between the results obtained in a scaled experiment and those anticipated for the full-scale prototype. This paper describes the application of the Buckingham Pi theorem to develop a set of non-dimensional parameters that are appropriate for describing the problem of a distributed load applied to the rostrum of the paddlefish. This problem is of interest because previous research has demonstrated that the rostrum is a very efficient structural system. The ultimate goal is to estimate the response of a complex, bio-inspired structure based on the rostrum to blast load. The derived similitude laws are verified through a series of numerical experiments having a maximum error of 3.39%.

Results show that the best values of cooling module are 1.1mm aluminum fin thickness, 7.5mm pitch, and 31mm height and can effectively reduce the LED junction temperature under 75°C at 90° incline angle. The impact of the incline angle of the LED vapor chamber-based plate to the thermal performance of the present cooling module should be assessed before such a structure of vapor chamber cooling system is used to cool high power LED system.

T2  - Advances in Engineering Software
AB  - Side weirs are widely used for flow diversion in irrigation, land drainage, urban sewage systems and also in intake structures. It is essential to correctly predict the discharge coefficient for hydraulic engineers involved in the technical and economical design of side weirs. In this study, the discharge capacity of triangular labyrinth side weirs is estimated by using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Two thousand five hundred laboratory test results are used for determining discharge coefficient of triangular labyrinth side weirs. The performance of the ANFIS model is compared with multi nonlinear regression models. Root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE) and correlation coefficient (R) statistics are used as comparing criteria for the evaluation of the models’ performances. Based on the comparisons, it was found that the ANFIS technique could be employed successfully in modeling discharge coefficient from the available experimental data. There are good agreements between the measured values and the values obtained using the ANFIS model. It is found that the ANFIS model with RMSE of 0.0699 in validation stage is superior in estimation of discharge coefficient than the multiple nonlinear and linear regression models with RMSE of 0.1019 and 0.1507, respectively.

T2  - Energy
AB  - This work deals with the prediction of the maximum efficiency achievable by turbines for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems by means of similarity principles. At present, this is a key topic in the preliminary design optimization procedures of these systems. The dimensional analysis applied to the most general ORC turbines scenario helps obtain the functional relationship between maximum turbine efficiency and the most relevant design variables within the general framework of the flow similarity. Aim of the work is to search for the less wide and more convenient set of independent similarity parameters to increase the accuracy of turbine efficiency data in the optimization of ORC systems. Results show that the strict flow similarity does not hold if the same design is used for different working fluids, because real gas compressibility effects cannot be disregarded for most of the fluids usually adopted in ORC systems. On the other hand, a “quasi-similarity” approach can be applied to the design of low volume expansion ratios ORC turbines using the size parameter (SP), volume expansion ratio (VR) and the compressibility factor (Z) as predictors of turbine efficiency. Accordingly, two original correlations for the SP-VR-Z map of optimized axial turbine stages are suggested.

AB  - A frictionless force transmission between the mechanical components of high production volume systems was accomplished by Rolling Element Bearings, which leads to being an imperative item of the condition-based maintenance (CBM). A prominent fault would cause malfunction, and its substantial growth may lead to catastrophic failure of such machinery ultimately give rise to unscheduled maintenance, and in extreme cases turns into a quite expensive shut down of the same. These decisive situations explore a growing demand for a robust failure diagnosis scheme for bearings. The present work demonstrates a novel approach to develop a dynamic model for vibration response of spherical roller bearings using dimensional analysis with Buckingham’s pi theorem (BPT) by considering significant geometric, operating, and thermal parameters of the system. The results obtained have been validated with experiments performed on the developed test rig under diverse operating conditions. Vibration amplitudes considerably enhanced in the presence of rotating speed, applied load, bearing temperature, and volume of defect. Multivariable regression analysis is performed to reveal the effectiveness of the model for precise detection of impending bearing failure. The vibration response obtained by the DA model, experimental runs, and MVRA agreeing with physical perceptive and potentials. Results indicate the simplicity and reliability of the approach.

AB  - A new methodology for analyzing heat and mass transfer in gas storage via adsorption has been developed. The foundation behind the proposed methodology comprises a set of physically meaningful dimensionless groups. This paper presents a discussion regarding the development of such groups, based on the Buckingham-Π theorem, providing a fully normalized multi-dimensional formulation for describing transport mechanisms involved in adsorbed gas storage. Data from previous literature studies are employed for determining realistic values for the developed parameters. Then, a one-dimensional test-case problem is selected for illustrating the effect of the dimensionless parameters on the operation of adsorbed gas reservoirs. This problem is numerically solved, and the solution is validated against previously published literature data. The presented results demonstrate that higher heat of sorption values can lead to reduced discharge capacities if the increased heating is not properly removed, whereas larger Biot and Fourier numbers can increase the amount of gas recovered.

TI  - Scale-up of photo-bioreactors for microalgae cultivation by π-theorem
AU  - Paladino, Ombretta

T2  - Biochemical Engineering Journal
AB  - Robust microalgae cultivation at industrial scale needs complex scale-up of photobioreactors since the same yields obtained at lab-scale are hardly reached during pilot or industrial production. In this paper we propose a procedure based on Buckingham π-theorem to perform the scale-up of photobioreactors used to cultivate Chlorella Vulgaris fed by CO2 and wastewater rich in glycerol. This theoretical approach is usually overlooked in favor of the synergy of modeling tailored on the process and piloting, but it grants excellent generalizability. An experimental campaign at three levels was designed and carried out to evaluate the characteristic dimensionless numbers individuated by the theoretical formulation. Since scale-up regards both geometrical dimensions and type of reactor, passing from lab-scale stirred tanks (STRs) to pilot scale tubular and airlift, particular attention was devoted to defining characteristic lengths inside the dimensionless numbers. Moreover, since scale-up also regards the operating mode, scaling from discontinuous to semi-continuous to continuous, some interesting dimensionless numbers arise other than Re, Sh, DaII. They are mainly related to the type of biological process and its operating mode and are the ratios O2/CO2 and T/Topt, the ratio between the incident light intensity and the saturation constant, the absorbance, the ratio between the final and the initial concentration c/c0, the ratio between the maximum increase in cell population and its initial concentration, the ratio between the estimated specific kinetic constant and a variable representing the characteristic time of mixing inside the chosen reactor. Preliminary outdoor tests confirmed the operability of the scaled-up airlift reactors reaching c/c0 = 5.3–7.5, with c = 1.15 g L−1 at extraction intervals of 5 days. They were operated under optimal light conditions of incident light greater than Chlorella v. saturation constant and absorbance = 40 and at incipient churn flow (Re = 10000–11000) with dimension of fluegas bubbles around 5 mm, apt to guarantee Sh = 1500–2500; and with a calculated DaII around 25.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the characteristics of oxygen dissolution into water in aeration using an orifice type microbubble generator (MBG). The analysis was conducted using dimensional analysis by taking into account bubble diameter distribution and oxygen mass transfer rate. The characteristics of microbubbles produced by MBG were affected by the combination of air and water flow rates through the MBG. In this study, the ranges of air and water flow rates were set at 0.1–1.0l/min and 30.0–80.0l/min, respectively. The microbubbles were captured by a high-speed camera using shadow photographic technique to obtain the bubbles size distribution as well as the average diameter of the bubbles. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient of oxygen was measured using dynamic physical absorption model. The results verified that the size of microbubble depend on air and water flow rates. The increase of the gas flow rate increased the average bubble diameter. On the other hand, the increase of the water flow rate decreased the average bubble diameter. Furthermore, the increase of water flow rate increased the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient. Finally, by using dimensional analysis, the empirical correlation of volumetric mass transfer coefficient, average bubble diameter, and bubble diameter distribution, was proposed. The correlation showed that liquid Reynolds number played most important role in average bubble diameter and oxygen mass transfer rate obtained in MBG aeration.

AB  - Multistage Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) undergo performance degradation when operating with highly viscous fluids. Several studies on this subject seek to provide models to predict the pump performance under such conditions. However, some of those models require knowledge of geometric parameters or are only designated for radial-type pumps. In this article, dimensional analysis is used as an alternative to analyse head and flow rate degradation of different pumps without the need of any major geometric parameters. To accomplish this task, head curves for two multistage, mixed-flow type ESPs are obtained through a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program for a wide range of viscosities and different rotational speeds. The numerical head curves were compared with experimental data under equivalent operating conditions and a good agreement was found. When adequate normalisations are used together with relevant dimensionless numbers, the head values obtained from the different ESPs proved to match quite well along curves of constant specific speeds. Experimental head values from literature for a radial-type centrifugal pump with volute operating with different fluid viscosities were used to extend the present analysis for a different pump geometry. Results from this procedure turned out to match the ESPs data well. A straightforward expression to correlate head and flow rate correction factors due to viscosity follows from the present approach, thus yielding a useful tool that might help in proposing a general method to estimate performance degradation.

AB  - A supercritical CO2 (S–CO2) Brayton cycle has a compact and simple layout, which suggests the possibility to serve as a small scale distributed power conversion system. Off-design behaviors of each component determine the system off-design performance in the S–CO2 power cycle. Among components, compressor performances have the largest impact on the system off-design analysis since it operates nearest to the critical point of CO2. In the system analysis, the off-design performance of a compressor is usually pre-calculated for the fixed inlet conditions. The performance map is then converted for the off-design performances prediction using corrected mass flow rate and corrected rpm. Similitude models are used for the conversion. Several similitude models have been developed mostly for air conditions previously, but the applicability of these models to S–CO2 still needs to be tested. In this paper, to evaluate the existing models for the S–CO2 conditions, experimentally validated 1D mean-line code is used to generate wide range of S–CO2 compressor data set. As a result of the evaluation, Pham model showed the most accurate enthalpy rise prediction resulting in the best pressure rise prediction, and the efficiency prediction could be modified with density correction to improve the off-design performance prediction.

T2  - Energy and Buildings
AB  - Nowadays worldwide directives have focused the attention on improving energy efficiency in the building sector. The research of models able to predict the energy consumption from the first design and energy planning phase is conducted to improve building sustainability. Use of traditional forecasting tools for building thermal energy demand tends to encounter difficulties relevant to the amount of data required, implementation of the models, computational costs and inability to generalize the output. Therefore, many studies focused on the research and development of alternative resolution methods, but the choice of the most convenient is not clear and simple. Single comparison of statistical quality indexes does not allow an adequate identification of the most efficient method, as the necessary efforts for implementation of the methods from the initial data collection to the use phase are not considered. In this work, the authors propose to apply, for the first time, the multicriteria assessment to determine the most efficient alternative method, used for forecasting of building thermal energy demand. Three alternative “black-box” methods, previously investigated by the authors, were compared by the multiple criteria Complex Proportional Assessment Method. Such a procedure revealed ranking of the methods in four phases, namely Pre-processing, Implementation, Post-processing and Use, as well as overall assessment and selection of the most efficient method in terms of evaluated criteria. This first application could represent an incentive for future multi-criteria analyses involving a growing number of alternative forecasting methods.

AB  - An imminent bearing fault detection can reduce downtime or avoid the failure of rotating machinery. Modern condition monitoring demands simple but effective bearing failure diagnosis by integrating dynamic models with intelligence techniques. In view of this, an integrated approach of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Dimensional Analysis (DA) is demonstrated to diagnose the size of the bearing faults. Several experiments were performed with artificially damaged bearings at different operating conditions on the developed rotor-bearing test rig. With a 0.1 mm error band to fix minor bugs, a two-performance indicator evaluated the model accuracy. Comparison of the performance of DA and ANFIS models with experimental and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) validated the potential of the present approach. The results showed that the simplicity of the DA and the superior performance of the ANFIS contributes to detecting bearing fault effectively and accurately in the diagnosis of industrial machines.

AB  - The rotating screen drums are largely used in most powder handling and processing industries. They are commonly used for size separation of granular materials. Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, screening efficiency and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined rotating screen drum for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating screen drum equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates. The shaping effects of the rotating screen drum were evaluated from the measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics (size distribution, water content, compactness, and circularity) on wet soft agglomerates. To describe the screening efficiency parameters of a rotary screen drum, a specific method was developed by using a matrix analysis of the different measured weights of the collected products. The impacts of rotating screen drum parameters (angle of inclination, rotating speed, and product flow rate) on the sieving efficiency and on the shaping effects were investigated. The present results demonstrate high apparent screening efficiency of the rotating screen drum when used with wet agglomerates of durum wheat, ranging between 89 and 96% depending on the process conditions Finally, using dimensional analysis, two correlations were proposed on the circularity and the apparent screening efficiency whatever the operating conditions used (drum speed, angle of inclination and feed rate).

AB  - A heat and mass transfer effectiveness definition relevant to clothes dryers is developed in this work. A correlation is presented for determining the effectiveness of heat and mass transfer in a horizontal-axis, tumble-type clothes dryer drum with axial airflow. The correlation is a function of four measurable quantities: air mass flow rate, cloth mass, air mass in the drum, and the fall time experienced by a cloth falling the full height (i.e. diameter) of the drum. The Buckingham Pi Theorem is applied to the problem in order to derive dimensionless terms upon which the effectiveness depends. Empirical data from several dryers are used to derive an empirical correlation as a function of the dimensionless variables. Three cloth types were investigated, and a separate empirical correlation is proposed for each. Together, the drum effectiveness concept and the correlation presented provide a new, more accurate, computationally efficient, and readily implemented framework for modeling and simulating clothes dryers. It is relevant to conventional gas and electric clothes drying appliances, vapor compression heat pump dryers, and thermoelectric heat pump clothes dryers. With appropriate empirical inputs, the framework is extensible to any thermal-evaporative cloth drying systems, including radial-flow horizontal axis tumble drying drums.

AB  - In this paper, both the mechanical behavior and the leakage characteristics of fabric rubber composite in aircraft door are investigated in detail based on microchannel model, which consider the influences of the microchannel shape, the elastic modulus, and the contact stress on the gas leakage rate of the fabric rubber composite. First, the explicit expression of the gas leakage rate at the contact interface of the fabric rubber composite is established based on the contact interface properties. Second, the explicit dimensionless function of the gas leakage rate at the contact interface of the rubber seal is proposed by means of dimensional analysis, finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Finally, the influences of the gas pressure on the gas leakage rate are studied under the same pressure difference at both sides of the fabric rubber composite. The predicted results of the gas leakage rate are in good agreement with the experimental results, which provide an effective model for evaluating the gas leakage characteristics at the contact interface of the fabric rubber composite under any gas pressure and compressive displacement.

AB  - A dimensionless model was proposed to scale-up the solid-liquid extraction of Eurycoma longifolia roots. ShSc−1 dimensionless number was found to be the best fit of all proposed models. At optimum conditions of the extraction process, which were duration of extraction of 53 min, solvent to raw material ratio of 12.5:1 and roots particle size of 0.5 to 1.0 mm, the extract yield of 8.76% at lab-scale produced ShSc−1 no. of 0.0312. Employing the scale up rule of P/V idem and scale-up factor of 7.65, the extract yield of 8.65% with 1.37% error was obtained at pilot-scale at ShSc−1 no. of 0.0376. The outcome of this study provided useful scale-up knowledge in ensuring smooth transition from lab-scale to pilot-scale.

AB  - Calanchi (plural of calanco) are typical badland landforms of the Italian landscape. They consist of dense networks of V-shaped valleys, with a sparse or absent vegetation cover, which frequently develop on unconsolidated or poorly consolidated clayey deposits. In this paper, the dimensional analysis and the incomplete self-similarity theory were used to deduce a model relating the volume of sediments eroded from the calanchi area to a set of geometric attributes of their tributary areas. The morphometric characteristics of 209 calanchi basins were used to calibrate and validate the model. The predictive skill of the model was assessed by calculating the mean square error and the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient. The model was found to provide a reliable prediction of eroded volume from basins entirely covered by calanchi landforms as well as from basins only partially affected by badland erosion processes. Furthermore, as the residuals between the calculated and the measured volume of the eroded material are normally distributed, the deterministic model may be considered complete, meaning that no other variables are necessary to explain the studied physical process. In other words, the model is able to predict erosion volume in calanchi landforms from a deterministic point of view.

T2  - International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer
AB  - This study conducted a heat flow-lighting performance test to evaluate and analyze an exceeding hundred watts of HI-LEDs (higher-power LEDs) projector. In addition, a Windows-based optimization program was developed to optimize the heat sink of the HI-LEDs projector. The results indicated that the maximal LED temperature of the projector was 108°C at a steady temperature state (approximately 1h of operation). When the metal-core printed circuit board (MCPCB) of the projector was replaced with a vapor-chamber PCB (VCPCB), the LED temperature decreased to 87.6°C. Iterative calculations were subsequently performed using the self-developed Windows-based optimization program for determining the optimal fin interval (8.94mm) and thickness (2.56mm). These optimal parameters were simulated using CFD (computational fluid dynamics), and the results were compared with those of the original 150-W HI-LEDs projector. A Rayleigh number of 6.1304×105 was obtained, indicating a laminar flow model. When the optimized heat sink was used, the LED temperatures for the MCPCB and VCPCB HI-LEDs projector samples decreased by 14 and 9.74°C, respectively. The h value of the optimized HI-LEDs projector (8.094W/m2k) was higher than that of the original HI-LEDs projector (7.154W/m2k), and its weight was reduced by approximately 2%.

We demonstrate that the lubrication theory for soft porous media (Feng and Weinbaum, J. Fluid Mech. 422, 282, 2000) is valid in describing the fluid pressurization, while the theory by Toll (Polym Eng Sci 38, 1337, 1998) is appropriate in predicting the solid phase lifting force. A new model is then developed for estimating the contribution of the fluid pressure to the total lift, which, along with extensive dimensional analysis, provides critical insights for the application of soft porous lubrication in industrial applications.

AB  - A mathematical model predicting the fluid flow dynamics of accidental clouds is introduced. It has been found that the dimensionless flammable cloud is related to the accidental leak rate, wind speed, and fluid by means of the balance between the release momentum and the convective wind flow. The non-dimensional cloud volume Vˆ ranges from 0.16 to 62 for the cases investigated. Numerical findings suggest a sinusoidal waveform (sine-cosine function) as in the trigonometric circle. This observation goes in line with the wind rose from meteorological data. The proposed mathematical model agrees very well with numerical data calculated using computational fluid dynamics.

AB  - An experimental investigation was carried out on the effects of high liquid viscosities on slug length in a 0.0762-m ID horizontal pipe using air-water and air-oil systems with nominal viscosities ranging from 1.0 to 5.5 Pa s. The measurements of slug length were carried out using two fast sampling gamma densitometers with a sampling frequency of 250 Hz. The results obtained show that liquid viscosity has a significant effect on slug length. An assessment of existing prediction models and correlations in the literature was carried out and statistical analysis against the present data revealed some discrepancies, which can be attributed to fluid properties in particular, low viscous oil data used in their derivation Hence, a new high viscous oil data presented here from which we derive a new slug length correlation was derived using dimensional analysis. The proposed correlation will improve prediction of slug length as well as provide a closure relationship for use in flow simulations involving heavy oil. This is important since most current fields produce highly viscous oil with some reaching 10 Pa s.

AU  - Sorgun, Mehmet
AU  - Muftuoglu, Tevfik Denizhan
T2  - Geothermics
AB  - Proper selection of pumps has been an important issue for energy efficiency in geothermal energy. In a research conducted among machines that consume electricity, pumps come first with 25 %. Accurate estimation of pressure losses is a key point in order to select pump systems. Hot water from the geothermal area is carried by pipeline systems. In this study, extensive experimental study is conducted at Izmir Katip Celebi University Flow Loop using pure water for fluid temperature from 25 °C to 60 °C, for four various relative roughness values, and for Reynolds Number ranges from 6.2 × 104 to 7.8 × 105. This study has mainly two objectives: First is to identify if the absolute pipe roughness values of commercially available pipes vary according to the pipe diameter. The second objective is to investigate fluid temperature effects on frictional pressure losses in rough pipes and to present a new friction factor correlation for using in geothermal pipelines, considering the fluid temperature effects. Experimental study shows that absolute pipe roughness varies substantially for pipe diameters. The proposed friction factor has a good agreement with explicit formulas of Blasius (1913) and Taler (2016) equations for smooth pipes and Colebrook (1939) equation for rough pipes, as well as experimental data at various temperature values. Additionally, frictional pressure losses are accurately estimated using new friction factor equation. Results show that both relative roughness and temperature have a significant influence on the friction factor for turbulent flow through rough pipes. For this reason, pipe roughness should be determined correctly and the effects of fluid temperature on pressure losses should be considered. This may influence frictional head losses per unit length and, consequently, the predicted pumping requirements in geothermal pipelines.

Testing of sub-scale models is still nowadays a valuable design tool, helping engineers to accurately predict the behavior of oversized prototypes through scaling laws applied to the obtained experimental results. In this manuscript it has been reviewed the developments in the methodologies used to create reduced scale models as a design tool, including those based in the use of: dimensional analysis, differential equations and energetic methods. Besides, given their importance, some major areas of research were reviewed apart: impacted structures, rapid prototyping of scale models and size effects. At last, some topics on which additional efforts can be undertaken are highlighted.

AB  - Progressive freeze-concentration is a technology to separate water from solutions by freezing. In the present investigation, ethanol-water solutions were freeze-concentrated by the progressive stirred technique. The freezing stage was carried out in a stirring vessel. Solute recovery by the fractionated thawing of ice was also studied. The effects of stirring speed (500, 1000, and 2000 rpm), initial concentration of the solution (3%, 5%, and 8% ethanol), and temperature of the thawing stage (0, 10, and 20 °C) on the solute yield and average distribution coefficient were determined using response surface analysis. The ethanol concentration was found to have increased by 1.3 and 2.1 times at the end of the freeze concentration process. It was found that the initial concentration had a significant effect on the distribution coefficient. In addition, the average yield was increased by 28% by fractionated thawing. Subsequently, a non-dimensional analysis of the distribution coefficient was developed to yield a model to predict the distribution coefficient as a function of the Reynolds number, the relationship between the average ice growth rate and the stirring speed, the agitator diameter, and the liquid fraction. This technique proved to be valid with respect to the concentration of ethanol-water solutions, with better yields being obtained at low initial concentrations. This model is the first of its kind to describe the ethanol-water interaction in agitated freeze-concentration systems.

T2  - Measurement
AB  - Electrochemical discharge drilling (ECDD) is a hybrid micromachining process that can be used to drill micro holes on all kind of materials, irrespective of their mechanical and electrical properties. In ECDD, the continual penetration of tool electrode having electrochemical discharge (ECD) energy along the work material generates the holes. The relative movements between tool electrode and work material controls the energy penetration rate, and subsequently effects the performance characteristics. Therefore, the effect of process parameters associated with feeding motion and ECD energy are important to investigate simultaneously with respect to the performance characteristics. In the current study, a Buckingham’s dimensional method was used to determine the relation between input process parameters (that includes simultaneous interaction of ECD energy based parameters and feeding motion based parameters) and performance characteristics. The material removal rate (MRR) and hole overcut (HOC) were considered as the performance characteristics. MRR and HOC symbolize the productivity and accuracy of the process, respectively. During predictive modeling, the constant terms and coefficients were estimated from the non-linear experimental data. The outcomes manifested by the predictive models are in good agreement with the experimental results. The underlying process mechanism for ECDD with the pressurized feeding system has been explored by considering the simulation results as an evidences. Microscopic images of machined holes and discharge characteristics were used to develop the fundamental background of ECDD process mechanism with pressurized feeding method. Additionally, genetic algorithm (GA) was used to perform the multi objective optimization of ECDD process.

T2  - Ocean Engineering
AB  - A semicircular breakwater model with rectangular perforations and with truncated wave screen(s) of different porosities has been developed in this study which could act as an anti-reflection wave barrier, providing wave protection to coastal and marine infrastructures. The hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater model is evaluated through wave measurements in a wave flume under irregular waves. The experiments are undertaken with three setups; (i) a wave screen is attached to the front curved wall of the semicircular breakwater and none at the rear wall, (ii) a wave screen is attached at the rear curved wall of the semicircular breakwater and none at the front wall and (iii) wave screens one each is attached to the front and rear walls of the semicircular breakwater. The wave surface elevations are measured at different locations upstream and downstream of the breakwater model and the coefficients of wave transmission, reflection and energy dissipation are determined. Wave climate in the vicinity of the breakwater and the horizontal wave force on the model are also measured and analysed. The results show that the semicircular breakwater with double screens of 25% porosity is the most viable design that offers reasonably good hydraulic performance as this acts as an energy dissipater rather than a wave reflector. Further, empirical models developed using a multi-regression method for estimation of reflection, transmission and energy loss coefficients as well as the normalised wave force coefficients, correlates well with the experimental data.

AB  - A detailed assessment of building energy performance requires a large amount of input data concerning building typology, environmental conditions, envelope thermophysical properties, geometry, control strategies, and several other parameters. Notwithstanding, the use of specialized software tools poses many challenges in regards to the retrieval of reliable and detailed information, setting a steep learning curve for engineers and energy managers. To speed up the preliminary assessment phase, it might be more convenient to resort to a simplified model that allows the evaluation of heating energy demand with a good level of accuracy and without excessive computational cost or user expertise. Dimensional analysis is a means of simplifying a physical problem by appealing to dimensional homogeneity to reduce the number of relevant variables. In this work, the authors investigated an alternative approach to assess the thermal energy demand of a high-performance-non-residential building. It was possible to define some dimensionless numbers that synthetically describe the links between the main characteristic parameters of the thermal balance by applying the Buckingham π theorem. After a detailed description of the Buckingham π theorem and of its application concerning the evaluation of the building energy balance, the authors identified nine “ad hoc” dimensionless numbers. The proposed methodology has been validated by the comparison of the heating energy demand calculated by detailed dynamic simulations carried out in TRNSYS according to the standards and laws of building energy requirements in seven different European countries. Applying a set of criteria, it was possible to employ a dimensionless number to determine, immediately and without any calculation or use of steady/dynamic software, the heating energy demand with an reliability >90%.

T2  - International Journal of Pharmaceutics
AB  - In pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing, the powder formulation is filled into a die and compacted into a tablet using rigid punches. Die fill is important because it limits the productivity of tablet presses and determines key quality attributes of tablets including weight and content uniformity. Die fill occurs due to gravity and suction fill mechanisms. A model linear shoe-die filling system has been instrumented with pressure measurement devices for detailed characterisation of air pressure evolution as the powder mass is delivered in the die. Systematic experiments were carried out using a range of microcrystalline cellulose powders to explore the role of powder properties (such as particle size and bulk density) and operating parameters (such as shoe and die geometry, shoe and suction punch kinematics and powder filling level) on powder delivery. Existing models were found inadequate to describe the mass flow rate of powders under a diversity of gravity and suction filling conditions. The pressure measurements enabled the development of a new die fill model using the Buckingham Π theorem. The model includes separate terms for the contribution of the mass of powder delivered under gravity and suction fill mechanisms. The experimental procedures required to extract the parameters of the model are described. The model is applicable to the handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders where small differences in air pressure have a significant impact on the powder flow process. The practical application of the model for predicting die filling behaviour in a high-speed rotary tablet press is demonstrated by assuming operating conditions of a typical rotary tablet press. This approach can be adapted to assist formulation design and process development for operations involving handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders.

AB  - A one-dimensional model of catalyst-coated fin in plate-fin heat exchanger reactors was developed in this study to consider the effects of heat of reaction on the fin efficiency. The results of the model showed that the occurrence of a surface reaction must be treated carefully since it drastically changes fin behaviour compared to conventional thermal fins. The impact of dimensionless numbers representing the coupling between fin geometry, surface reaction and heat and mass transfer was investigated, and limit conditions where a reactive fin behaves as a conventional thermal fin was circumscribed according to these parameters. The results of the developed reactive fin model were also compared to computational fluid dynamics simulations and showed very good representativeness for all heat transfer, reaction and by-pass effects. The comparison demonstrated that this simplified model is strong enough to represent reactive fins on the surface of which a catalytic surface reaction occurs, for both laminar and turbulent flows in square millichannels.

AB  - Aeration experiments were conducted in a brick masonry tank of dimension 4m×4m×1.5m to study the design characteristics of pooled circular stepped cascade (PCSC) aeration system. Based on dimensional analysis, non-dimensional numbers related to geometric, dynamic and process parameters were proposed. The non-dimensional geometric parameters – number of steps (N), ratio of total height of cascade (H) to the bottom radius of cascade (Rb), % coverage of circumference of each step by enclosure (Pe) and number of enclosures in each step (Ne) were optimized. Maintaining the optimized geometric parameters (N=6, H/Rb=0.25, Pe=20% and Ne=9), aeration experiments were further conducted at different discharges (Q) to develop simulation equations for prediction of aeration characteristics of PCSC aeration system at different dynamic conditions. Simulation equations for oxygen transfer and power consumption based on Froude (Fr) criterion were developed subject to 0.0014≤Fr≤0.0144. SAE of the developed prototype PCSC aerators based on estimated brake power ranged between 2.43 and 3.23kg O2/kWh.

AB  - In this paper, the double arc interaction mechanism is investigated and the double arc offset is quantitatively analyzed in the high-power double-wire double pulsed gas metal arc welding (DP-GMAW). Arc offsets in the synchronous and alternating phases were captured using high-speed photography and corresponding voltage and current waveforms were simultaneously recorded during the welding process. Experimental results show the arc offset behavior is affected by the electromagnetic field, arc pressure, and arc stiffness. In the alternating phase, offset of the base arc is largest and offset of the peak arc is smallest. In the synchronous phase, the base and peak arc offsets are somewhere between those in the alternating phase. Dimensional analysis method was used to analyze the factors influencing arc stiffness and in addition, the effects of arc stiffness on arc offset were examined. Increasing the arc stiffness can prevent arc offset, by reducing measurement and experimental errors. Furthermore, the arc stiffness effects were found to be more prominent during the strong pulse compared with the weak pulse, and the arc offsets were smaller in the strong pulse. In the alternating phase, the base arc promotes the formation of molten metal deposits, resulting in the appearance of more prominent fish scales compared with the synchronous phase. Marangoni convection in the weld pool becomes stronger as the phase difference between the two arcs decreases. Moreover, the weld width increases, weld penetration becomes shallower and the weld reinforcement will be lower.

AB  - In this paper, the experimental results of the performance test of a direct absorption solar collector using PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) coated silver nanofluid as working fluid were obtained at different operating conditions such as different nanofluid volume fractions, different tilt angles, and different rate of flows. The dimensional analysis technique was utilized to develop an empirical correlation for collector efficiency. Also an empirical correlation is introduced for calculating Nusselt number in terms of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers to specify the amount of heat loss in direct absorption solar collector. Also, a comparison between experimental and correlated results was carried out. The results showed that the bias errors were 2.46% and 5.98% for Nusselt number and collector efficiency, respectively. Consequently, Average Standard Deviation (ASD) values reached 7.31% and 18.04% for both, respectively. The correlations presented can be used in calculating Nusselt number and collector efficiency for performance analysis of direct absorption solar collectors. It helps to enhance design calculations of this new type of solar collectors.

AB  - Observations in the Mandovi estuary, located on the central west coast of India, have shown that the salinity field in this estuary is remarkably time-dependent and passes through all possible states of stratification (riverine, highly-stratified, partially-mixed and well-mixed) during a year as the runoff into the estuary varies from high values (∼1000 m3 s−1) in the wet season to negligible values (∼1 m3 s−1) at end of the dry season. The time-dependence is forced by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and hence the estuary is referred to as a monsoonal estuary. In this paper, we use a three-dimensional, open source, hydrodynamic, numerical model to reproduce the observed annual salinity field in the Mandovi. We then analyse the model results to define characteristics of residual estuarine circulation in the Mandovi. Our motivation to study this aspect of the Mandovi's dynamics is derived from the following three considerations. First, residual circulation is important to long-term evolution of an estuary; second, we need to understand how this circulation responds to strongly time-dependent runoff forcing experienced by a monsoonal estuary; and third, Mandovi is among the best studied estuaries that come under the influence of ISM, and has observations that can be used to validate the model. Our analysis shows that the residual estuarine circulation in the Mandovi shows four distinct phases during a year: a river like flow that is oriented downstream throughout the estuary; a salt-wedge type circulation, with flow into the estuary near the bottom and out of the estuary near the surface restricted close to the mouth of the estuary; circulation associated with a partially-mixed estuary; and, the circulation associated with a well-mixed estuary. Dimensional analysis of the field of residual circulation helped us to establish the link between strength of residual circulation at a location and magnitude of river runoff and rate of mixing at the location. We then derive an analytical expression that approximates exchange velocity (bottom velocity minus near freshwater velocity at a location) as a function of freshwater velocity and rate of mixing.

T2  - Applied Thermal Engineering
AB  - The supercritical heat transfer processes of n-decane during pyrolysis in rectangular tubes having three different equivalent diameters are studied numerically. The effects of mass flow rate (2–5 g/s), heat flux (109–436 kW/m2), and three different channel configurations having the same cross-sectional areas on the supercritical heat transfer characteristics of n-decane during pyrolysis are investigated. The heat transfer mechanisms are analysed from the perspective of pyrolysis, thermophysical properties, wall shear stress, and thickness of the boundary layer. The results demonstrate that the heat transfer coefficient increases with mass flow rate. The heat transfer coefficient decreases with increasing heat flux at the inlet section of the heating tube; however, the trend is reversed after a certain distance. The heat transfer coefficient decreases with the increase in the equivalent diameter. The thinning of the boundary layer thickness, increase in the wall shear stress, primary pyrolysis reaction, increase in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and decrease in the viscosity enhance the heat transfer. Based on the considerable deviations between the computational fluid dynamics simulation results and the existing heat transfer correlations, the Dittus–Boelter correlation is modified such that it can be applied to predict the supercritical heat transfer coefficients of n-decane during pyrolysis in the above rectangular tubes.

AU  - Haase, S.
T2  - International Journal of Multiphase Flow
AB  - Current research proofs the potential of apparatuses containing minichannel flow structures to intensify gas-liquid-solid contacting processes. The excellent heat and mass transfer in these devices as well as a sharp RTD mainly result from the Taylor flow regime. A proper design of corresponding contactors requires precise information on the provided interfacial areas. However, the characterisation of gas-liquid Taylor flow with industrially relevant fluids at elevated pressure and created by capillary injection devices gained little attention so far. This work analyses adiabatic gas-liquid Taylor flow in a square minichannel of 1.0mm hydraulic diameter using water, water-glycerol, or water-ethanol mixtures as liquid phase and hydrogen or nitrogen as gas phase to cover a broad range of material parameters. In the mixing zone located within the flow channel, gas was injected into the co-flowing liquid by so-called capillary injectors with variable inner diameter (0.184, 0.317, 0.490mm). Two different bubble forming mechanisms were identified leading to a complex interaction between physical properties of the fluids, geometrical parameters and the observed gas bubble and liquid slug lengths. According to the Pi-theorem, these lengths were affected by 6 dimensionless groups, namely (uG,s/ uL,s), ReL, WeL, (dIn,CI/ dh), (dOu,CI / dh), and Θ*. Based on more than 370 experimental data, novel correlations to predict gas bubble and liquid slug lengths were developed.

AB  - In this study, the multi-parameter constrained optimization procedure integrating the design of experiments (DOE), full factorial experimental design (FFED), genetic algorithm (GA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are proposed to design a gas diffusion layer (GDL) linked to a wavy channel. The Forchheimer–Brinkman extended Darcy model and two-equation energy model are adopted to describe the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics in the porous media. Numerical computations are performed with a wavy channel for the parameters studied. That is, Reynolds number (Re), wave amplitude (α), wave number (β) and gas diffusion layer porosity (ε) in the range of 200≤Re≤1000, 0.1≤α≤0.3, 2≤β≤10, 0.4≤ε≤0.5, respectively. The interactive effects of Re, α, β, and ε on the local Nusselt number (Nu) and the average Nusselt number (Nu¯) are discussed in this study. The results show that computations of local and average Nusselt numbers within the wavy channel are enhanced compared to the straight channel. In addition, the optimization of this problem is also presented by using a full factorial experimental design and the genetic algorithm (GA) method. The objective function defined as thermal performance factor (TPF) has developed a correlation function with three design parameters. That is, wave amplitude α, wave number β and gas diffusion layer porosity ε. The results show that the thermal performance factor (TPF) prediction can be approached under the maximum error of 6.2% from the present regression model, which is compared with CFD results.

T2  - Acta Biomaterialia
AB  - The membrane–cytoskeleton system plays a major role in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation. F-actin filaments, cross-linkers, binding proteins that bundle F-actin filaments to form the actin cytoskeleton, and integrins that connect the actin cytoskeleton network to the cell plasma membrane and extracellular matrix are major cytoskeleton constituents. Thus, the cell cytoskeleton is a complex composite that can assume different shapes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based techniques have been used to measure cytoskeleton material properties without much attention to cell shape. A recently developed surface chemical patterning method for long-term single-cell culture was used to seed individual cells on circular patterns. A continuum-based cell model, which uses as input the force–displacement response obtained with a modified AFM setup and relates the membrane–cytoskeleton elastic behavior to the cell geometry, while treating all other subcellular components suspended in the cytoplasmic liquid (gel) as an incompressible fluid, is presented and validated by experimental results. The developed analytical–experimental methodology establishes a framework for quantifying the membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity of live cells. This capability may have immense implications in cell biology, particularly in studies seeking to establish correlations between membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity and cell disease, mortality, differentiation, and migration, and provide insight into cell infiltration through nonwoven fibrous scaffolds. The present method can be further extended to analyze membrane–cytoskeleton viscoelasticity, examine the role of other subcellular components (e.g., nucleus envelope) in cell elasticity, and elucidate the effects of mechanical stimuli on cell differentiation and motility.
Statement of Significance
This is the first study to decouple the membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity from cell stiffness and introduce an effective approach for measuring the elastic modulus. The novelty of this study is the development of new technology for quantifying the elastic stiffness of the membrane–cytoskeleton system of cells. This capability could have immense implications in cell biology, particularly in establishing correlations between various cell diseases, mortality, and differentiation with membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity, examining through-tissue cell migration, and understanding cell infiltration in porous scaffolds. The present method can be further extended to analyze membrane–cytoskeleton viscous behavior, identify the contribution of other subcellular components (e.g., nucleus envelope) to load sharing, and elucidate mechanotransduction effects due to repetitive compressive loading and unloading on cell differentiation and motility.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - In recent decades, demand for energy has been significantly increased, and considering environmental impacts and the degrading nature of fossil fuels, clean and emission-free renewable energy production has attracted a great deal of attention. One of the most promising renewable energy sources is solar energy due to low cost and low harmful emissions, and from the 1980s, one of the most beneficial applications of solar energy is the utilization of solar chimney power plants (SCPP). A SCPP is a simple and reliable system that consists of three main components; a solar collector, a chimney (tower) and a turbine to utilize electrical energy. Recently, by the advancement in computer technology, the use of CFD methodology for studying SCPP has become an extensive, robust and powerful technique. In light of the above, in this study, numerical simulations of a SCPP through three-dimensional axisymmetric modeling is performed. A numerical model is created using CFD software, and the results are verified with an experimental study from the literature. After ensuring good agreement with the experiments, chimney’s and collector’s geometric parameters effects and different configurations effects on SCPP performance, simultaneously and additively is investigated. The study introduces an insight to the performance enhancement methods and finding the best configuration of a SCPP model, which will be the basis of a detailed prototyping process. Based on the numerical results, the best configuration of the SCPP has been found as the diverging chimney which enhances the generated power. The results of the study showed that the chimney height and collector radius increase has a positive effect on the power output and efficiency of the system, but when construction and material costs are also considered, each has an optimal value. The maximum impact on the performance is found to be by the chimney tower radius and the collector height and inclination are found to have optimum values considering performance. According to the obtained results, the best performance for the SCPP was obtained with 3.5 m chimney height, 30 cm tower diameter, 400 cm of collector diameter with 6 cm height and zero inclination angle. By the correct selection of the dominant performance parameter which can be done by correctly interpreting the results of this study, “the best” design of a SCPP real scale prototype considering maximum power requirement can be done.

T2  - Computers & Fluids
AB  - For the first time, a set of Lattice-Boltzmann two-way coupling pointwise Euler-Lagrange models is applied to gas mixing of sludge for anaerobic digestion. The set comprises a local model, a “first-neighbour” (viz., back-coupling occurs to the voxel where a particle sits, plus its first neighbours) and a “smoothing-kernel” (forward- and back-coupling occur through a smoothed-kernel averaging procedure). Laboratory-scale tests display grid-independence problems due to bubble diameter being larger than voxel size, thereby breaking the pointwise Euler-Lagrange assumption of negligible particle size. To tackle this problem and thereby have grid-independent results, a novel data-scaling approach to pointwise Euler-Lagrange grid independence evaluation, based on an application of the Buckingham π theorem, is proposed. Evaluation of laboratory-scale flow patterns and comparison to experimental data show only marginal differences in between the models, and between numerical modelling and experimental data. Pilot-scale simulations show that all the models produce grid-independent, coherent data if the Euler-Lagrange assumption of negligible (or at least, small) particle size is recovered. In both cases, a second-order convergence was achieved. A discussion follows on the opportunity of applying the proposed data-scaling approach rather than the smoothing-kernel model.

AB  - Experiments and theoretical modelling have been carried out to predict the performance of a solar-powered liquid desiccant cooling system for greenhouses. We have tested two components of the system in the laboratory using MgCl2 desiccant: (i) a regenerator which was tested under a solar simulator and (ii) a desiccator which was installed in a test duct. Theoretical models have been developed for both regenerator and desiccator and gave good agreement with the experiments. The verified computer model is used to predict the performance of the whole system during the hot summer months in Mumbai, Chittagong, Muscat, Messina and Havana. Taking examples of temperate, sub-tropical, tropical and heat-tolerant tropical crops (lettuce, soya bean, tomato and cucumber respectively) we estimate the extensions in growing seasons enabled by the system. Compared to conventional evaporative cooling, the desiccant system lowers average daily maximum temperatures in the hot season by 5.5–7.5 °C, sufficient to maintain viable growing conditions for lettuce throughout the year. In the case of tomato, cucumber and soya bean the system enables optimal cultivation through most summer months. It is concluded that the concept is technically viable and deserves testing by means of a pilot installation at an appropriate location.

AB  - In this study, a quantitative non-contact detection method for gas leakage problem based on infrared thermography technology is developed. First, the relationship between the gas leakage rate and the temperature gradient at the edge of the leaking hole is established based on thermodynamics, dimensional analysis and numerical methods. Second, the temperature fields surrounding the gas leakage location are extracted using an infrared thermal imager. Both the gas leakage location and leakage rate are obtained for the damaged rubber seals. Finally, the detections of gas leakage location with arbitrary shape and no obvious temperature difference are discussed and generalized. These results will play an important role in detecting the leakage rate for the damaged seal structures or containers.

AB  - This paper presents an original form of surrogate models and the associated construction procedure adapted to the thermal modeling of Multiphysics systems. This method of meta-modeling, which uses dimensional analysis, extracts compact models suitable for preliminary design from finite element simulations. The mathematical expression used for the model is a product of variable power laws of dimensionless numbers. Compared to traditional surrogate models (polynomial response surfaces, kriging and radial basis functions), it has the advantage of giving light, compact forms with good predictive accuracy over a wide range of the design variables (several orders of magnitude). The general regression process is first explained and illustrated with a study of the Marangoni effect. Then the methodology is used to build thermal models of an electromechanical actuator (EMA) which are used to size an aileron EMA for two different cooling strategies. Finally the models are also used to discuss the effect of confinement on the actuator’s overall thermal resistance.

T2  - International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
AB  - When hydrogen or oxygen is produced from water splitting by electrolysis, thermochemical cycles or solar-based photocatalytic methods, bubble flow and vapor transfer into the gas phase occur during phase transition. This undesirable vapor transfer requires the use of more energy input to compensate for the evaporation heat requirement as well as for subsequent gas purification in the downstream unit. In this paper, both experimental and modeling studies are performed to examine the dynamics of bubble flows and kinetics of water vapor transfer, particularly related to processes of hydrogen production. Experimental data are obtained using an advanced laser-based shadow imaging system and on-line vapor monitoring system. The bubble dynamics and water vapor transfer kinetics are modeled with non-dimensional parameters involving the bubble diameter, velocity and trajectories so that the water vapor transfer rate can be quantified under different operating conditions for various hydrogen production methods. Also, a predictive model is developed to simulate the physical processes of bubble transport in a vertical liquid column, as it occurs in water splitting processes such as oxygen generation in the thermochemical copper–chlorine cycle, as well as hydrogen generation in electrolytic and photocatalytic processes.

AB  - BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) phenomenon is one of the major industrial accidents observed in gas processing industry, which remains a major concern for risk decision-makers. BLEVE blast wave mechanism has been widely studied by several authors who proposed simplified approaches based on simple physical models or empirical correlations, but only few approaches including analytical solutions have been undertaken. Moreover, the simplified and empirical approaches are not very satisfactory because they overestimate overpressure measures. In this paper (Part I), an analytical model based on Sedov-Taylor blast wave solution and self-similar theory, which is of great interest in various fields of physics, is proposed for estimating BLEVE overpressure effects. The parameters characterizing the blast wave evolution (overpressure, radius and velocity) are established by applying the Vashy-Buckingham theorem (Pi theorem). To demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to deliver reliable predictions, a validation with large and medium-scale BLEVE experiments issued from the literature is carried out. Furthermore, a comparison with the TNT equivalent model and other models (empirical and simplified physical) is performed. The results of these comparisons are very encouraging and show good agreement in terms of precision. This is Part I of two papers, focusing on description and validation of the Sedov-Taylor blast wave model. Part II deals with application of the model on a LPG accumulator in an Algerian gas processing unit.

T2  - Journal of Membrane Science
AB  - This study is aimed at developing a predictive model of pervaporation performance, particularly permeation flux, as a function of physicochemical properties of permeant–membrane material and process conditions. A new approach was introduced that the developed model took into account all the steps of transport mechanism in pervaporation, i.e., sorption, diffusion, and desorption. A new term so-called permeation conductance was used and was correlated to selected affecting physicochemical properties and process conditions on the above three steps through dimensional analysis. The permeation flux (Ji) was modeled as a multiplication of an overall permeation conductance (koverall,i) and a driving force of feed concentration (CF,i). A large data based was assembled from the literature and our experiments; 87% of it was used for model training, and the remaining was for testing. The model was found to give fairly good predictions on pervaporation performance. The relative ratio of molecular interactions (solubility parameter) of permeant–permeant over that of permeant–membrane (ΔSolij/ΔSolim) and the operating temperature (T) were found to be the most influencing physicochemical property and process condition on the permeation flux.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental study on the hydrodynamic performance of seawalls in terms of wave reflection coefficient (Kr), relative wave run-up (Rup/Hi), and relative wave run-down (Rdown/Hi). Various experiments were carried out under monochromatic waves to test five non-traditional seawall setups; plane wall (PW), rectangular serrated wall (RSW), triangular serrated wall (TSW), slotted wall (SLW), and triangular serrated-slotted wall (TSLW). A thin-parallel solid wall with a water chamber width (D) was used on the leeward side of SLW and TSLW in order to preclude the wave transmission. RSW was found hydrodynamically superior as compared with TSW. The blocks spacing of RSW and TSW were hydrodynamically optimized at a value of 2.5 times the width of the block. Nevertheless, the hydrodynamic behaviour of both SLW and TSLW was optimal when the slots ratio was about 0.33, whilst the chamber width was about 0.25 of the incident wavelength. New empirical formulas were developed for understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of the proposed seawalls using nonlinear regression analysis. These formulas were calibrated using SPSS based on the experimental results. The formulas were used to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of both RSW and TSLW for El-Tinah Plain Bay in the North-East coast of Egypt.

AB  - Energy storage can facilitate the transition process from the actual energetic model to a model based on renewable energies. A lot of attention has been put in such technology, being the use of phase change materials (PCM) of high interest. However, design methodologies for PCM storage systems are still a limiting factor for its deployment. This paper compiles and structures the most common and promising design methodologies and highlights their usefulness and limitations. These methodologies are classified in six types: (1) empirical correlations and characterizing parameters, (2) dimensional analysis and correlations, (3) effectiveness–NTU, (4) Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD), (5) Conduction Transfer Functions (CTF), and (6) numerical models. Dimensionless correlations and effectiveness–NTU are the most common and straight-forward methods as well as the ones that offer more possibilities for general solutions. Empirical correlations and numerical models are problem based and difficult to generalize. On the other hand, the adaptation of LMTD and CTF to PCM systems still requires detailed research.

AB  - Energy-efficient, small and lightweight high-power light-emitting diodes (Hi-LEDs) are combined with a thermo-generation module (TGM) to transform the heat power generated by the LED into electric energy in the present paper. Variation in the dielectric copper and solder layer thickness in the printed circuit board (PCB) composite was found to affect the thermal performance of the Hi-LEDs lighting system, and a vapor chamber (VC) was shown to provide excellent heat dissipation performance when used with Hi-LEDs. Therefore, VC and PCB (VCPCB) were combined for integration with the Hi-LEDs package system (micro-generator with LED vapor chamber-based plate, LED-MGVC) for performance and illumination comparison. This study analyzes the performance of a novel LED-MGVC device using experimental and illumination-analysis methods with VCTM V1.0. Results depict that the LED-MGVC system provides significant improvement for thermal performance and illumination and thermoelectric properties.

AB  - It is experimentally shown that the stability of non-overflowing pneumatic foams, such as those used in the Bikerman foam stability test, is strongly dependent upon the gradient of humidity within the freeboard of the column. Growing foams can be prevented from exhibiting collapse, even at surfactant concentrations significantly lower than the critical micelle concentration, by saturating the air above the foam surface thereby preventing liquid evaporation. These observations have important implications for the performance of flotation devices, as well as instruments designed to measure the stability of aqueous foams. Meteorological data for two mining sites in Australia throughout a single year shows the variability of humidity, and therefore stability, of flotation froths.

AB  - Honeycomb sandwich panel has been widely used in aerospace and aeronautic engineering as load-bearing components. Cost-effective shielding structure can also be built based on honeycomb sandwich panel. The shielding properties of honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to high-velocity impact is of great concern to spacecraft design. Three dimensional internal-structure-based simulation research of honeycomb sandwich panels under high-velocity impact is carried out. The point-type internal structure model is constructed, where the impacted area is refined to capture localized deformation and improve the accuracy. The internal structure model is validated by experimental results and empirical formula. Then typical impact processes are simulated to investigate the cutting and channeling effect of the honeycomb core on the projectile. Projectile mass, impact velocity and internal-structure parameters of the honeycomb core are varied to obtain their influences on the channeling effect of the fragmented projectile. The thickness of the honeycomb core influences is found to affect much on the shape of the hole on the rear facesheet. Three empirical equations with respect to impact parameters and internal structure parameters are presented based on numerical results and the dimensional analysis.

T2  - International Journal of Mechanical Sciences
AB  - In this study, we investigate buckling and postbuckling of etching-induced wiggling in a bilayer structure consisting of mask and masked layers. To show effects of explicit modeling of etching process, two mask–masked ridge models with and without etching (Models w/E and w/oE) are analyzed using finite element analysis. The etching process is explicitly introduced via step-by-step eigenvalue buckling analysis. Although Model w/oE predicts a constant value of the critical wavelength of wiggling regardless of the change in ridge width, Model w/E predicts a shorter wavelength depending on the decrease in ridge width and the increase in intrinsic compressive stress in the mask layer. In postbuckling analysis, Model w/oE predicts a monotonic increase in the wiggling amplitude with the constant wavelength, whereas Model w/E predicts saturation of the wiggling amplitude owing to the decreasing wavelength. In the explicit modeling of etching process, the wiggling behavior shows completely opposite tendencies. Dimensional analysis is performed to obtain empirical equations, which are compared with an experiment.

AB  - In this paper, the lateral disturbance (loading imperfection) is considered as another new external factor which causes compression instability of composite besides fiber misalignment (structure imperfection). Four typical stages of the unidirectional fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites compression instability are established: uniform compression, elastic instability, plastic deformation and plastic instability in which some suggestions on material performance that can be delayed for each stage propagation are given. Then, the compressive behaviors induced by loading and structure imperfection are compared regarding elastic and plastic buckle. In addition, the theoretical prediction model of compressive strength considering coupling influence of loading and structure imperfection has been proposed. Finally, the coupling theoretical prediction models has been verified by numerical calculation and experimental results which could provide new idea for solving low compressive strength of the FRP composite.

AB  - Assimilating unique features of genetic programming (GP) and gene expression programming (GEP), this study introduces a hybrid algorithm which results in promising incipient non-cohesive sediment motion models. The new models use the dimensionless input parameters including relative particle size, relative deposited bed thickness, channel friction factor and channel bed slope to estimate particle Froude number in rectangular channels. The models’ accuracy is tested using different error measures and cross-validated through comparison with that of five empirical models available in the relevant literature. The results showed enhanced accuracy of the proposed models in comparison to the existing ones with concordance correlation coefficient of 0.92 and 0.94 for parsimonious and quasi-parsimonious ensemble GP models, respectively. Such superiority is attributed to the integrated use of flow, fluid, sediment and channel characteristics in the modeling of incipient motion. Although the new algorithm is hybrid, the proposed models are explicit and precise, and thus, motivating to be used in practice.

AB  - The detection of the defective/worn out bearing components used in rotating machines is one of the main concerns in various applications. To improve the computational efficiency in the nonlinear dynamic analysis for the rolling contact bearings, a new methodology based on dimensional analysis (DA) theory is proposed in this paper. The developed model is used to predict the vibration responses due to artificially spalled bearing components to quantify the level of structural damages into these components. The use of a back propagation neural network (BPNN) has been made that also predicted responses from the network trained by developed algorithm using the experimental data obtained from the defective bearing components on the developed test rig. A comparison between the responses predicted by proposed DA method and the BPNN showed a fair amount of the agreement between the two approaches and validated the proposed model and proved outstanding tool for identification of spalled/damaged bearing components.

AB  - In this work, we investigated the role of four independent process parameters, namely product temperature at the heat exchanger outlet, mean residence time, temperature increase between the heat exchanger inlet and outlet, and heat effectiveness, in the protein denaturation, aggregation, and fouling of a β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) concentrate that was chosen as model fluid for milk derivatives. A pilot-scale plate heat exchanger in countercurrent configuration, supplied with a holder, was used in order to mimic industrial process conditions. The denaturation level and aggregates size of the heat treated β-lg concentrate at the exchanger and holder outlets, along with the fouling mass in the plate heat exchanger were simultaneously determined. The results indicated that β-lg denaturation, aggregation, and fouling reactions were mainly governed by the temperature profile in the investigated range of operating conditions, even though a small influence of residence time and heating rate was highlighted in the less denaturing conditions. A dimensional analysis was performed to identify the key dimensionless numbers governing β-lg denaturation, aggregation, and fouling mechanisms in the heat treatment of a β-lg concentrate. This allowed to emphasise the major influence of the Arrhenius exponential factor of β-lg unfolding reaction, both related to temperature and β-lg reactivity. The first Damköhler and Reynolds numbers, related to residence time and hydrodynamic conditions in the heat exchanger, as well as the heat exchange process parameters, linked to the heat effectiveness and the bulk-wall temperature differences, had also a small impact on β-lg chemical behaviour. Moreover, empirical relationships based only on the Arrhenius exponential factor of β-lg unfolding reaction permitted to describe the main trends observed in denaturation levels, aggregate sizes, and fouling masses, which underlined the predominant role of temperature and β-lg reactivity in the investigated operating conditions. This study outlines finally that fast heat treatments permit to minimise fouling issues.

AU  - Bódai, Tamás

T2  - Renewable Energy
AB  - In this paper we consider a wave energy converter concept which is created by linking a box barge to the mechanical reference by linear dampers. The response to incident wave action in terms of power take-off is expressed explicitly as the solution of a linear frequency-domain model. The simplicity of the model combined with the possibility of the application of theory allows for a nested, and so manageable, procedure of optimization. We find that for any geometry, i.e., a combination of e.g. the breadth-to-length and breadth-to-draught aspect ratios of the box, the optimum is characterized by resonance at least in one of the two degrees of freedom, heave or pitch. Furthermore, optimal geometries turn out to be extremal: either long attenuator-type or wide terminator-type devices perform the best. We find also that optimal wavelengths, which are comparable to the device length in case of attenuators, emerge either due to the progressively increasing buoyancy restoring force characteristic, or due to the finite bandwidth of irregular waves. In particular, diffraction forces are more significant under optimal conditions for performance in irregular seas in comparison with conditions necessary for the most intensive displacement response of the free-floating box barge exposed to regular waves.

T2  - International Journal of Mechanical Sciences
AB  - Scaled experimentation plays an important role in prototype and process development but is recognised to be severely constrained by the need for similitude, founded on the concepts of geometric, kinematic and kinetic similarity. This paper examines the possibility of breaking the requirement for geometric similarity by introducing the law of finite similitude for anisotropic scaling, which applies to continuum mechanics on anisotropically-scaled spaces. The law confirms that similarity solutions on skewed spaces always exist separately for quasistatic deformational and thermal-continuum problems. Thermomechanical and continuum dynamic problems however are shown to suffer from the inclusion of a (non-physical) non-orthogonal metric arising from the skewed coordinate system associated with anisotropic-space scaling. Even in this case however, an important subclass of problems is shown to be physically realisable involving a dominant component of velocity (displacement), where geometric similarity can again be broken yet retain good accuracy. The ability to skew artefacts yet achieve similitude is recognised to be a particularly important outcome as it allows for example one experimental model to be used to predict the behaviour of multiple skewed models. To showcase and highlight the significance of the new concept various scaled numerical models with anisotropic scaling with different geometrical scaling ratios in different directions is considered. The applicability of the theory is tested on a number of case studies providing strong supporting evidence for the validity and applicability of the new theory.

TI  - Modelling of fluid flow through short tube orifices under metastable conditions: A new numerical validation approach for evaluating the mass flow rate with refrigerant mixtures (HFC-407C and HFC-410A)
AU  - García-Valladares, O.
AU  - Santoyo, E.
T2  - Applied Thermal Engineering
AB  - In a previous work, one-dimensional numerical modelling of fluid-flow inside short tube orifices was performed, and successfully validated against a wide range of mass flow rate measurements reported for the refrigerant HFC-134a. Governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy and entropy were solved for describing the fluid flow under a wide variety of thermodynamic transitions (e.g., subcooled liquid region, metastable liquid region, metastable two-phase region and equilibrium two-phase region), including sudden contraction and enlargement. In this new study, a comprehensive comparison analysis between numerical simulation data and experimental measurements obtained for HFC-407C and HFC-410A refrigerants (No = 241) to extend the applicability of the same mathematical model was carried out. Using a widespread statistical analysis, based on weighted linear regressions with an outlier detection/rejection module at 95% of confidence level, the prediction performance of the mathematical model was again assessed. Linear regressions between predicted mass flow rate data and experimental measurements were computed, and used them as a statistical comparison criterion. A statistical comparison between predicted simulation results and mass flow rate experimental data are reported. Average deviation errors of ±11.1% (for the refrigerant HFC-407C) and ±7.3% (for refrigerant HFC-410A) were found between numerical model and experimental data. These results demonstrate a new and robust application of the model to predict reliably the mass flow rate through short tube orifices under metastable conditions, which enable this tool to be reliably used for the design of short tube orifices.

AB  - Explosions threaten the safety of buildings and occupants by inducing severe damage to concrete structural elements. The effects of close-in and contact loading situations on RC plates have been investigated in literature and the common approaches employ field test results condensed in engineering charts based on cube-root scaling. In this paper, a new analytical model based on a physical framework is developed to (a) investigate shock wave attenuation along the depth of the concrete plate and (b) predict the size of crater damage. The analytical model for shock wave pressure is discussed in comparison to prediction data from established numerical models and existing experimental results. Moreover, consistency of the newly proposed model with established scaling rules is verified with respect to crater size.

TI  - Experimental characterization of pulsed Newtonian fluid flows inside T-shaped micromixers with variable inlets widths
AU  - Silva, Jose Pedro
AU  - dos Santos, Aires

T2  - Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science
AB  - Fluids mixing in microfluidics is hindered by the laminar flow regime operation and, therefore, it constitutes an important challenge. Symmetrical and asymmetrical T-micromixers are used to assess the mixing quality improvement, when pulsed signals are imposed to the inlet flows. The used chips are manufactured using polydimethylsiloxane and soft lithography techniques. The flow images are acquired with a high frequency/resolution camera coupled to a microscope, and then are digitally processed. For both symmetrical and asymmetrical geometries, the mixture quality is characterized for non-pulsed flows at different Reynolds numbers, evidencing its fundamental influence on the mixing performance. For pulsed flows, the analysis is based on the parameters that characterize the imposed wave. Results show that the application to both inputs of pulses in phase opposition is the most beneficial, with maximum performance increases of 100% and 90.6%, respectively for the symmetrical and the most asymmetrical micromixers. Moreover, the increase of the pulse amplitude yields an increase of the mixing quality (maximum increase of 90.6% for the most asymmetrical micromixer). Additionally, the increase in frequency results in a decrease of the mixing quality. The width reduction of the outlet channel enhances the mixing quality due to the appearance of vortex structures, whereas its length had no particular influence on the results. From the flow images acquired at instant t, T⩽t⩽2T, the experimental data of αmix for pulsed flows correlate according to αmix=Re2.17Wa×WbDH4.79Va+VbV6.034ΔQπVDH20.0151+θ2π0.698DHVt1.51St-0.0073, with the non-dimensional parameters varying in the ranges 156⩽Re⩽289; 6.15×10-5⩽St⩽3.08×10-4; 7.5×10-1⩽Wa×WbDH⩽1.06; 1.5⩽(Va+Vb)V⩽2; 8.59×109⩽4ΔQπVDH2⩽3.44×1010; 1⩽1+θ2π⩽1.5; and 1.54×10-5⩽DHVt⩽3.81×10-5.

Experiments were performed to investigate the pressure drops for both single and immiscible two component liquid-liquid aqueous-organic flows through the same rectangular serpentine channel with medium sand packing. The experimental results are enunciated with the available models for both empty and packed channels. Empirical models are developed to predict the pressure drop and friction factor for both single and two-component liquid-liquid flows through the prescribed serpentine geometry based on operating variables. The present work may be useful for further understanding of the multiphase system in the serpentine micro-dimensional unit for its design and development.

TI  - A review of numerical analysis of friction stir welding
AU  - He, Xiaocong

T2  - Progress in Materials Science
AB  - Friction stir welding is a relatively new solid-state joining technique which is widely adopted in different industry fields to join different metallic alloys that are hard to weld by conventional fusion welding. Friction stir welding is a highly complex process comprising several highly coupled physical phenomena. The complex geometry of some kinds of joints and their three dimensional nature make it difficult to develop an overall system of governing equations for theoretical analyzing the behavior of the friction stir welded joints. The experiments are often time consuming and costly. To overcome these problems, numerical analysis has frequently been used since the 2000s. This paper reviews the latest developments in the numerical analysis of friction stir welding processes, microstructures of friction stir welded joints and the properties of friction stir welded structures. Some important numerical issues such as materials flow modeling, meshing procedure and failure criteria are discussed. Numerical analysis of friction stir welding will allow many different welding processes to be simulated in order to understand the effects of changes in different system parameters before physical testing, which would be time-consuming or prohibitively expensive in practice. The main methods used in numerical analysis of friction stir welding are discussed and illustrated with brief case studies. In addition, several important key problems and issues remain to be addressed about the numerical analysis of friction stir welding and opportunities for further research are identified.

T2  - International Journal of Multiphase Flow
AB  - We perform a series of experiments to measure Lagrangian trajectories of settling and rising particles as they traverse a density interface of thickness h using an index-matched water-salt-ethanol solution. The experiments confirm the substantial deceleration that particles experience as a result of the additional force exerted on the particle due to the sudden change in density. This stratification force is calculated from the measurement data for all particle trajectories. In absence of suitable parameterisations in the literature, a simple phenomenological model is developed which relies on parameterisations of the effective wake volume and recovery time scale. The model accurately predicts the particle trajectories obtained in our experiments and those of Srdić-Mitrović et al. (1999). Furthermore, the model demonstrates that the problem depends on four key parameters, namely the entrance Reynolds number Re1, entrance Froude number Fr, particle to fluid density ratio ρp/ρf, and relative interface thickness h/a.

AB  - The Working Group on the Analysis and Management of Accidents (WGAMA) was created on December 31st, 1999 to assess and strengthen the technical basis needed for the prevention, mitigation and management of potential accidents in NPP and to facilitate international convergence on safety issues and accident management analyses and strategies. WGAMA addresses reactor coolant system thermal-hydraulics, in-vessel behaviour of degraded cores and in-vessel protection, containment behaviour and containment protection, and fission product (FP) release, transport, deposition and retention, for both current and advanced reactors. As a result, WGAMA contributions in thermal-hydraulics, computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) and severe accidents along the first two decades of the 21st century have been outstanding and are summarized in this paper. Beyond any doubt, the Fukushima-Daiichi accident heavily impacted WGAMA activities and the substantial outcomes produced in the accident aftermath are neatly identified in the paper. Beyond specific events, most importantly, around 50 technical reports have become reference material in the different fields covered by the group and they are gathered altogether in the reference section of the paper; a common outstanding feature in most of these reports is the recommendations included for further research, some of which have eventually given rise to some of the projects conducted or underway within the OECD framework. Far from declining, ongoing WGAMA activities are numerous and a number of them is already planned to be launched in the near future; a short mention to them is also included in this paper.

AB  - This paper presents all procedures used to obtain a reliable analytical model for the evaluation of the aerodynamic noise in fans used for cooling electrical motors. The final result is a mathematical model with parameters adjusted with both experimental data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. In the validation of the proposed model, 135 experimental evaluations of noise level were done on different fans and it was verified that about 70% of the obtained results showed difference of ±1.5dB in relation to the predicted by the new model, and 93% of the results showed difference of ±2.5dB. It is important to emphasize that this difference is small when compared with results obtained by other existing methods. Besides, it is also shown in this paper a technique for optimization of fan rotors with respect to aerodynamic noise level.

T2  - Applied Ocean Research
AB  - With climate changes and global warming, the extent of Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in the polar region is widening, and there is now more research attention on the wave interactions with broken ice covers within the zone to gain insights into its future sea conditions. Towards this objective, the dispersion and attenuation of surface waves propagating through segmented floating viscoelastic covers was investigated experimentally in this study. The covers were made of oil-doped Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material, with different curing agent percentages to vary their rheological properties. For stiffer covers, the measurements showed that the effect of segmentation on wavelength modification was significant, and the dispersion relation agreed generally with the existing theoretical predictions for discrete floating elastic segments despite the presence of the additional viscosity for the material. At the same time, the earlier empirical formula based on the concept of “equivalent rigidity” to represent the segmented elastic cover, did not work well for the conditions investigated. With more flexible covers, however, the effect of segmentation became insignificant for thin cover thickness. Given the present experimental conditions, we confirmed that the effect of scattering was negligible, and the wave attenuation should be attributed to the various dissipative mechanisms. An empirical relation for the attenuation was established based on the experimental results, to quantitatively relate the attenuation coefficient to the incident wave characteristics and cover properties. The relation identifies a significant inverse relationship with the viscosity of cover material, and thus confirms the essential role of viscoelastic representation for the attenuation predictions.

AU  - Aimmanee, S.

T2  - Thin-Walled Structures
AB  - This article discusses a method developed for predicting the deformation behavior of a Belleville spring under axial loading by using the minimum potential energy principle. Strain energy and work done of the Belleville spring are formulated based on the classical thin shell theory in a conical coordinate system. The von Kármán and Reissner approximations to the nonlinear strain-displacement relations take the geometrical effects of the moderately and very large axial deflection into consideration, respectively. The Ritz method is used to solve for the deformation and force characteristics of isotropic springs and the solutions are compared with the seminal equation of Almen and Laszlo, experiments, and finite element analyses. The present energy model can capture the effect of a geometric parameter that has been missing from the formulation of Almen and Laszo. The comparison shows that the developed method gives very good agreement with the results from the testing and finite-element method, whereas in most cases, owing to their limited assumptions, Almen and Laszlo's equation overpredicts the applied load at a given deflection. This energy model is also applicable for composite Belleville springs with orthotropic material properties. A load factor and a orthotropic factor are defined to readily analyze load-deflection relationship of the composite springs based on the existing relationship of the isotropic elastic spring.

AB  - In a conventional HDH system, a constant feed of seawater is required to run the system. As a result of extracting freshwater from the saline water, it is rejected at higher salinity, thus it cannot be recirculated as a feed again. The aim of this study is to come up with a zero-brine discharge system that eliminates the continuous need for the supply of source and sink in the conventional system. Based on the fact that earth's atmosphere holds a vast amount of water that can be considered as a reliable freshwater resource, especially in coastal areas. A water-from-air system is proposed in this study. The proposed system configuration comprises of two parts, a basic HDH system that uses a liquid desiccant solution instead of saline water and a desiccant-based air dryer. The liquid desiccant leaves the HDH part at a higher concentration due to the extraction of freshwater. It then enters the air dryer where it is diluted by absorbing water vapor from the ambient air. This diluted desiccant is directed to the HDH part to close the desiccant loop. In this study, Lithium chloride is used as the working fluid of the proposed system. Mathematical modeling of heat and mass transfer processes between the air and desiccant in the humidifier and dehumidifier is developed to predict the performance of the desalination system. The proposed system produces about 8 kg of freshwater per hour.

T2  - Ocean Engineering
AB  - The paper investigates the linear-elastic and nonlinear stiffnesses of a suction caisson used as monopod foundation for an Offshore Wind-Turbine (OWT). Starting from caissons at low working stresses, in which case the linear elastic theory provides an adequate engineering model for soil, analytical expressions for the elastic stiffness matrix of a flexible skirted foundation are proposed and validated. To account for the nonlinear foundation response, the paper proposes a simplified equivalent linear iterative approach where the effective foundation stiffness is expressed in terms of deformation amplitude. To this end, utilizing results from a 3D finite element parametric study, non-dimensional charts have been produced for caissons ranging from perfectly rigid to flexible with variable embedment ratios. To deal with uncertainty on the conditions at the soil-skirt interface, three idealized interface scenarios – “fully-bonded”, “tensionless”, “frictionless” – are implemented. Reduced values of foundation stiffness are computed for a frictionless contact. On the contrary, the impact of a “tensionless” interface, whilst trivial in elastic problems, is intensified with progressing soil inelasticity resulting in severely reduced stiffnesses and capacities. Moreover, with increasing relative skirt flexibility, the elastic stiffnesses of deep suction caissons tend to recede substantially, but the rate of stiffness degradation is fairly attenuated.

TI  - A design method of micro-perforated panel absorber at high sound pressure environment in launcher fairings
AU  - PARK, Soon-Hong
T2  - Journal of Sound and Vibration
AB  - Abstracts
A design method of micro-perforated panel absorbers is proposed for the enhancement of acoustic absorption inside the payload fairings of launch vehicles. An empirical acoustic resistance model of a micro-perforated panel absorber in a high sound pressure environment is suggested to this end. The resistance model is especially appropriate for the launcher fairing application, so that the incident pressure to the surface of bare fairings is considered as a main variable. Other design variables, e.g., the minute hole diameter, the perforation ratio and the thickness of the panel, are also considered in the proposed model. The estimated acoustic resistances and corresponding absorption coefficients are verified by comparing them with the measured results for several micro-perforated panel absorbers having a practical range of parameters. The estimated and measured results show good agreement when the perforation ratio is in the range of 1.4% to 5.3%. The effects of design parameters on the absorption coefficient are discussed. It is demonstrated that the micro-perforated panel absorber with a large hole diameter (about 1.0mm), which shows a poor sound absorption at low pressure levels, can be a good sound absorber at high incident pressure levels. A set of design charts is provided and this enables one to readily design a micro-perforated panel absorber for the mitigation of acoustic loads in launcher fairings.

T2  - Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering
AB  - Multiphase flow models involve more variables than available equations, thus closure relationships are required to solve the system of partial differential equations. In the Drift Flux Model, the mean drift velocity of the gas phase is estimate using the drift velocity closure relationship. This study investigates the motion of a single elongated bubble in high viscosity stagnant liquids in order to propose a comprehensive closure relationship for the bubble drift velocity. Different cases were run with inclination angles varying from 0° (horizontal direction) to 90° (vertical upward). OpenFOAM, an open source Computation Fluid Dynamics software, was used to numerically solve the two-phase incompressible flow problem. Drift velocities based on the movement of the bubble tip and the void fraction weighted averaged were compared to clarify the ambiguity in the drift velocity calculation and measurement. For horizontal pipe cases, the deformation of the bubble caused the drift velocity to be higher at the tip of the bubble than the drift velocity inside the bubble. For inclination angles more than 0°, the drift velocity at the tip is the same as inside the bubble. The closure relationship proposed is validated against experimental data in the literature. The results indicate that the closure relationship has a maximum 10% absolute average relative error for the viscosity range of 0.14–1.120 Pa·s, pipe size up to 0.152 m and pipe inclinations from 0° to 90°. The limitations of the closure relationship and potential enhancements for future studies are discussed.

AB  - The effect of elevated pressure on the hydrodynamics of a pilot-scale bubble column reactor has been studied in the non-Newtonian liquid phase. Various hydrodynamic characteristics of the bubble column reactor including the total gas holdup and its axial distribution, operating flow regime transition point, pressure fluctuation and its standard deviation have been evaluated by means of several pressure traducers along the column height. The superficial gas velocity and operating pressure varied from 1 to 35 (cms−1) and 0.1 to 1.0 (MPa), respectively. It was found that the total gas holdup increases with an increase in the operating pressure. The operating flow regime transition point was shifted to higher superficial gas velocities at elevated pressures. The standard deviation of pressure fluctuations was also found to increase with operating pressure but to decrease with the elasticity of the liquid phase. A new correlation has also been developed to predict the gas holdup in bubble columns operating at elevated pressures. The new correlation was shown to be able to predict the experimental data of gas holdup within a mean absolute percentage error of 20%.

TI  - Hydrodynamic and mass transfer in inertial gas–liquid flow regimes through straight and meandering millimetric square channels

T2  - Chemical Engineering Science
AB  - Heat-exchanger reactors are an important part of process intensification technology. For plate geometries, one solution for intensifying transfer and increasing residence times is to construct two-dimensional meandering channels. Supported by this scientific context, the present work aims at characterising gas–liquid mass transfer in the same square millimetric meandering channel, as in Anxionnaz (2009), this constituted the preliminary step required for performing exothermic gas–liquid reactions. Firstly, the gas–liquid hydrodynamics were characterised for a water/air system. When compared to a straight channel of identical compactness and sectional-area (2×2mm2), the meandering channel induced (i) a delay in the transition from Taylor to annular-slug regimes, (ii) a rise of 10–20% in bubble lengths while conserving almost identical slug lengths, (iii) higher deformations of bubble nose and rear due to centrifugal forces (bends). Secondly, an original method for verifying the relevancy of the plug flow model and accurately determining kla was used (measurements of concentrations in dissolved oxygen along the channel length). For the Taylor flow regime, kla increased coherently when increasing jg, and the meandering geometry had a small influence. On the contrary, this effect was found no more negligible for the slug-annular flow regime. Whatever the channels, the NTUl remained low, thus showing that, even if millimetric channels allowed to intensify kla, a special attention should be paid for generating sufficient residence times. At identical compactness, the meandering channel was found to be the most competitive. Finally, results on gas–liquid interfacial areas and mass transfer coefficients were confronted and discussed with respect to the predictions issued from the model developed by Van Baten and Krishna (2004).

AU  - Fardisi, S.

T2  - 8th International Symposium on Engineering Turbulence Modelling and Measurements, Marseille, France,June 9 to 11, 2010
AB  - The transient formation and subsequent dispersion of the plumes of a fixed mass of lighter than air gases emerging out of open cylindrical enclosures with negligible pressure difference was investigated using 3-D and 2-D CFD models. Subsequently, the dispersion into atmosphere of a similar amount of equally buoyant hot air was also considered. The structure and dynamics of the resulting thermally driven hot air plumes were compared to the corresponding characteristics of the mass-transfer driven isothermal plumes. Some cases were investigated in which the dispersing gases were both lighter than air and at a different temperature from that of the atmosphere. The similarities and differences of these double heat-mass-transfer driven problems with the other cases were discussed. It was shown that a criterion developed previously for judging the validity of the 2-D model relative to the more complex 3-D approach for mass-transfer driven problems could be equally applied for the thermally driven or double heat and mass-transfer driven plume flow characteristics.

TI  - Two-phase mass flow coefficient of V-Cone throttle device
AU  - He, Deng-Hui
AU  - Bai, Bo-Feng
T2  - Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science
AB  - The V-Cone throttle device has been paid more and more attentions on the measurement of the wet gas flow in recent years. However, it tends to over-read the gas flow rate when directly used to measure the wet gas. How to correct this over-reading and obtain an accurate yet simple wet gas correlation is still one of the challenges in the investigation on the V-Cone throttle device. In this paper, the two-phase mass flow coefficient of the V-Cone throttle device was proposed to correct the deviation of the readings produced by the device. The parameters affecting the coefficient were determined and discussed experimentally. Two V-Cone throttle devices with the respective equivalent diameter ratios of 0.65 and 0.75 were investigated under the condition of the wet gas flow. The test fluid was air and tap water. The gas-to-liquid density ratio ranged from 0.002445 to 0.006083, and the gas densiometric Froude number ranged from 0.3 to 2.0. The influencing parameters including the Lockhart–Martinelli parameter, the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the gas densiometric Froude number and the equivalent diameter ratio were studied. Then the correlations of the two-phase mass flow coefficient and the influencing parameters were proposed for the two V-Cone throttle devices and evaluated experimentally. The results show that the relative deviations of the correlations are less than ±5.0% and the average deviations of the correlations are 2.06% and 2.22% for the V-Cone throttle devices with the equivalent diameter ratio of 0.65 and 0.75, respectively. It can be concluded that the two-phase mass flow coefficient of the V-Cone throttle device is crucial for the development of the wet gas correlation.

AB  - This paper deals with the modeling and optimization of a photochemical reactor for the production of hydroxyl radicals. These radicals can be used in advanced oxidation processes for water purification. The UV-lamps used in the photochemical reactor lead to a relatively high energy and operating cost. Minimization of these costs is possible via a model-based optimization of the reactor geometry. First, a model is built taking into account the reaction kinetics, the reactor geometry and the radiation intensity distribution in the reactor. Afterwards, two different configurations of photochemical reactors are optimized. The first modeled reactor configuration is a single-lamp reactor and consists of a cylindrical UV-lamp that is present inside a quartz sleeve, outside of which the water flows between it and the external reactor wall (annular channel reactor). A rigorous optimization problem is formulated consisting of the calculation of the optimal reactor geometry (length and radius) in such a way that, for a given reactor volume and a given flow rate of the water to be treated, the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. By solving this optimization problem, it has been shown that an optimal reactor length exists. If the absorption coefficient of the water or the reaction rate constant increases, the optimal reactor length increases as well. The second modeled reactor configuration is similar to the first one but now contains multiple lamps positioned symmetrically in a circular pattern (i.e. multi-lamp reactor). The optimization problem consists of the calculation of the optimal lamp position inside the reactor in such a way that the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. The lamp position is given by the radial distance between the centers of the reactor and a lamp. Again a well-posed optimization problem is obtained and an optimal lamp position exists. If the number of lamps or the reaction rate constant increases or the absorption coefficient of the water decreases, the optimal distance between the centers of the reactor and the lamp increases.

T2  - Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering
AB  - The paper presents a parametric study on the seismic response of bridge piers founded on gravity caissons. Despite the wide use of caissons in bridge engineering, until a few years ago this foundation typology has been less investigated than piles and shallow foundations in both static and dynamic field. In most of the published studies, the seismic design of bridge piers was carried out without accounting for soil-structure interaction or by means of an uncoupled approach in which the superstructure was solved independently from the soil-caisson subsystem. In this study, coupled systems made of soil, caisson, pier and deck were analyzed in the time domain by a 3D finite element approach, considering rigid and massive caissons embedded in linear viscoelastic soils. In addition to unravelling the contribution of kinematic and inertial interaction to the total response of the caisson-bridge-pier systems, the study focuses on a particular aspect of kinematic interaction, overlooked in practical design and in most of previous studies, represented by the kinematic bending arising in the bridge pier due to the pier-to-deck joint rigidity. For some critical combinations of soil compliance, caisson geometry, pier height and input motion characteristics, the pier-deck constraint could induce kinematic bending moments in the pier as important as the inertial ones. A closed-form equation was finally proposed to predict the maximum kinematic moment in the bridge pier as a function of the key model parameters identified through the parametric study.

AB  - Manufacturing of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals often comprises the handling of solid/liquid suspensions both in upstream and downstream processing. Continuous manufacturing of such products is promising compared to conventional batch production, even though, flow processes in tubular devices usually suffer from particle settling and clogging. The isothermal suspension flow behaviors of various solid/liquid systems, i.e., crystalline l-alanine/saturated aqueous solution, PVC beads/water, and glass beads/water, with up to 10 wt-% of particles were investigated and successfully operated in horizontal helical coil tubes without blockage. The densimetric Froude number is used to describe the flow behavior in the coiled tubes in which three different regimes were observed, i.e., homogeneous suspension flow, moving sediment flow, and stagnant sediment. Empirical correlations based on the tube diameter, the mean particle size, the particle mass fraction, the fluid flow rate, the pulsation characteristics of the utilized peristaltic pump, and the physical properties of the system were developed for the critical densimetric Froude number to define the transition between these regimes. Based on this, the particle residence time distributions (RTDS) in the different flow regimes were investigated by step-response experiments from 0 to 1 wt-% of PVC particle tracers in aqueous suspension in a horizontal coiled flow inverter (CFI). A narrow RTDS close to ideal plug flow was found. These results enable both equipment and process design in existing equipment on a short-cut model level.

AB  - Herein, we describe a method that can be used to estimate the surface equi-biaxial residual stress of a material using instrumented sharp indentation. In this method, the fractional change in the loading curvature, rather than the contact area, was chosen as the analytical parameter; this fractional change can be more precisely obtained. A linear relationship between the fractional change in the loading curvature and the normalized equi-biaxial residual stress was found via dimensional and finite element analysis, and this linear relationship greatly simplifies the formulas associated with this method. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully verified using experimental data from our laboratory and from the literature.

T2  - International Journal of Impact Engineering
AB  - Ship collision with bridge piers is one of the most frequent types of accidents that may lead to a bridge failure. The collision characteristic of bow structure is significant to the study ship-pier collision process. In this paper, the quasi-static compression test and numerical simulation of a simplified bow model were carried out to study the static stiffness characteristic of the ship bow for further comparison with the dynamic ones. To evaluate the performance of reinforced concrete (RC) piers against ship collision, and to guide the design of the bridge piers and anti-collision, scaled model tests of ship-pier collision and finite element simulations based on the main pier no. 217 of the Shijiu Lake Bridge were carried out. The damage process and failure mode of the pier were analysed. Instead of rigid or elastic materials in most of the previous works of numerical simulation of ship collision with bridge piers, the bridge pier is modelled with nonlinear materials to simulate the pier characteristics more accurately. To examine the reasonability of the scaled model tests, finite element analysis of the full-scale ship-pier collision was conducted. In the light of the numerical results, the design impact loads prescribed by Eurocode and AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications were evaluated. Parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effects of the dynamic parameters and impact velocity on the impact force and ship bow crush depth.

Changes from a basic design have been introduced in order to evaluate the improvement in the efficiency as a coastal protection structure. Incident and transmitted waves have been measured, as well as the efforts in the mooring lines and module connectors. It has been found that the width of the pontoons is one of the key design parameters, while small modifications in the floating breakwater's cross section shape are less determinant in its hydrodynamic behaviour and in mechanical loads in the discussed ranges. 2D and 3D tests were conducted, observing the great influence that the wave obliquity has in the module connector forces.

AB  - To study the anti-galloping effect of interphase spacers with different kinds of arrangements on an iced transmission line, wind tunnel experiments using a full aeroelastic model are carried out in this work. Using similarity theory, the similarity criteria between the aeroelastic model and the prototype have been deduced. A triangular arrangement of three phases is considered, and the arrangements of iced eight-bundled conductors with and without the spacers are divided into six cases. In the experiments, laser sensors at different positions along the span of each phase are used to measure the variation of dynamic displacements with wind speed. Furthermore, galloping characteristics, such as the responses, frequencies, vibration modes, amplitudes and distance between two phases, are obtained for different wind speeds and arrangements. The obtained results show that interphase spacers have a certain inhibitory effect on the first symmetric mode and the first anti-symmetric mode galloping, but not all of the arrangements have a positive effect. The regularity of the variation with wind speed of the anti-galloping effect with interphase spacers is summarized. The galloping amplitude curves indicate that the amplitude is likely to be larger when a modal transformation occurs, in contrast to the results obtained without interphase spacers. The motion of the phase C located close to the diffusion section is different from those of the other two phases. Moreover, due to interphase spacers, the distance between the two phases is increased. The obtained conclusions can be used to predict the positions of interphase spacers and provide a fundamental tool for anti-galloping of eight-bundled conductors.

AB  - Applied in this paper is a new technique for scaling metal forming processes, founded on the idea that scaling can be achieved by scaling space itself. With this approach, the physics in two spaces is described using transport equations and are deemed to possess finite similitude if found to be proportional. Finite similitude can be shown to always exist in continuum mechanics for isotropic scaling and it is demonstrated here how the concept can be used to design experiments. Validation of the approach is achieved by means of scaled experimental, numerical and analytical solutions of scaled upsetting tests for cylindrical and ring samples. Three trial materials are tested and distinguished by the degree of strain softening, strain hardening and near perfect-plastic behaviour. Finite similitude results confirm that any discrepancies between the maximum loads are substantially reduced when the new scaling theory is applied. Best results are obtained when the same material is adopted for both full and small-scale experimentation.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the main advantage of the additive manufacture technology is to allow building miniature structural parts with a large degree of complexity such as to replicate structural details of real-scale marine structures. This work presents a new technique for reproducing the structural response of large-scale thin-walled metallic structures when subjected to crushing loadings by using scaled-down additive manufactured models. This technique couples scaling laws for strain rate sensitive materials and a thickness distortion technique based on the structural collapse mode. In order to validate this coupled technique, the structural response of a large-scale crushing test of a web girder structure was experimentally replicated by using a 1/40 scale reduction model. The results and conclusions summarize the prospects and limitations of additive manufacturing of miniature complex marine structures for structural purposes and crashworthiness verification.

AB  - The submerged combustion vaporizer (SCV) is indispensable general equipment for liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminals. In this paper, numerical simulation was conducted to get insight into the flow and heat transfer characteristics of supercritical LNG on the tube-side of SCV. The SST model with enhanced wall treatment method was utilized to handle the coupled wall-to-LNG heat transfer. The thermal–physical properties of LNG under supercritical pressure were used for this study. After the validation of model and method, the effects of mass flux, outer wall temperature and inlet pressure on the heat transfer behaviors were discussed in detail. Then the non-uniformity heat transfer mechanism of supercritical LNG and effect of natural convection due to buoyancy change in the tube was discussed based on the numerical results. Moreover, different flow and heat transfer characteristics inside the bend tube sections were also analyzed. The obtained numerical results showed that the local surface heat transfer coefficient attained its peak value when the bulk LNG temperature approached the so-called pseudo-critical temperature. Higher mass flux could eliminate the heat transfer deteriorations due to the increase of turbulent diffusion. An increase of outer wall temperature had a significant influence on diminishing heat transfer ability of LNG. The maximum surface heat transfer coefficient strongly depended on inlet pressure. Bend tube sections could enhance the heat transfer due to secondary flow phenomenon. Furthermore, based on the current simulation results, a new dimensionless, semi-theoretical empirical correlation was developed for supercritical LNG convective heat transfer in a horizontal serpentine tube. The paper provided the mechanism of heat transfer for the design of high-efficiency SCV.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Science
AB  - A simplified mathematical model and numerical simulations of the governing Navier–Stokes equations are used to predict the shape evolution, rupture distance, and liquid distribution of stretching pendular liquid bridges between two equal-sized spherical solid particles. In the simplified model, the bridge shape is approximated with a parabola, and it is assumed that the surface tension effects dominate the viscous, inertial, and gravitational effects. For the numerical simulations, a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package – FLUENT – is used. The rupture distance predictions obtained with both models are compared with experimental data and a reasonable agreement is found. The results of the numerical investigations show that for simulations with negligible viscous, inertial, and gravitational effects, the rupture distance approaches an asymptotic value, which is close to the value predicted by the simplified model. The bridge profiles predicted using the simplified model and the numerical simulation are compared. It is found that a second-order polynomial appropriately represents the stable bridge shape for particles with identical contact angles; however, for liquid bridges between particles with different contact angles, the numerical simulations of the governing Navier–Stokes equations should be used.

AB  - Experimental tests of the collision of reduced scale naval structures is here detailed described. First, a web girder section constructed in two different scales, 1/1 and 1/4, is subjected to the impact of a rigid indenter at mid span. The second experiment employs a more complex structure: a head-on collision of a 1/100 scaled tanker against a rigid obstacle. Special attention is given to some similarity complications that are frequent in real tests: model yielding stress different from the prototype and material strain rate. Since the standard similarity laws are unable to deal with those issues, it is shown how to modify the scaling factors to generate a replica similar to the corresponding prototype. Results are shown that support the approach with the modified scaling factors producing a behavior closer to the full-size structure. In the study of the ship head-on collision, only a 1/100 scaled specimen could be tested. In this case, the equivalent prototype was calculated with the assistance of the scaling factors and compared with empirical formulations found in the literature. The methodology depicted in this manuscript can be used as a guidance for scaled impact tests of vessels and other types of large structures.

T2  - International Journal of Mineral Processing
AB  - In a sintering bed the generation of melt in the descending flame front causes the coalescence of material and the transformation of the particulate bed. Interspersed between the large voids are the densified lumps of sinter which are released on crushing and used as blast furnace feed. The bed transformation process is critical in sintering and is an outcome of the work done on the material by the surface and opposing viscous forces. Less densified, weaker sinter forms when the level of coalescence achieved is low. The process is extremely complex in that it involves a three-phase melt–solids–gas system. In this study, the composition of the sinter bed was simulated using the pressed cylinders of laboratory grade chemicals and the coalescence process was studied by characterising the densification of the cylinders. The alumina, magnesia and basicity of the cylinders were altered (1–4%, 0–2% and 0–3, respectively) to change the properties of the melt and also its solid content. The estimation of solid–melt content, melt composition, viscosity and surface tension was obtained using a thermodynamic model (FactSage) and the reported equations in the literature. Using these results Laplace number of the system was determined as a function of temperature. At the completion of some tests the cooled solidified samples were studied under a microscope. The experimental results showed that the higher sinter density and densification factor were obtained when temperature and sinter mix basicity increased and alumina levels decreased. The effect of magnesia level on densification was less because the porosity of the cylinders altered with magnesium carbonate levels. The trends obtained in sinter densification are consistent with the micro-structural information indicated by optical micrographs. The use of Laplace number to quantify the relative influence of the surface to viscous forces on coalescence was encouraging with a prediction error within ±10%. It was also concluded that the most influential factor determining densification factor was the apparent viscosity of the molten mix as the change in surface force was comparatively small.

T2  - Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering
AB  - Plunger lift is an economical method to solve the liquid loading problem in industry and has been paid more and more attentions in recent years. Because of the inevitable annular gap between plunger and tube wall, the liquid above the plunger may leak downward during lifting process. How to model and reduce the liquid leakage flow rate is still challenging to optimize the plunger lift method. In this paper, the geometric and operating parameters affecting the liquid leakage in plunger lifting process were determined and discussed. Seven different diameter ratios between plungers and tube of 0.90–0.98 were investigated experimentally, and the optimal diameter ratio (0.96) was obtained. Based on the force balance over plunger and liquid column, a physical model for the liquid leakage during plunger lifting process was proposed. Combining the experimental data of pressure loss in tube, a dimensionless correlation of liquid leakage flow rate for the optimal diameter ratio (0.96) was developed. The results showed that the relative deviation of the correlation is less than ±10.0%. The influencing parameters including the Euler number of liquid, the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the gas and liquid Froude number, the liquid Reynolds number, and the ratio of lifting distance and loading liquid height were studied. The decrease of the initial differential pressure of liquid column and the increase of the gas production mass flow rate make positive contributions to reduce the liquid leakage flow rate during lifting process.

T2  - International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow
AB  - In this work the flow features in the near field of single and twin synthetic jets are experimentally investigated. An acoustic resonator is designed as a cavity split in two equal sub-cavities by the membrane of a loudspeaker. Each sub-cavity is connected to the quiescent ambient by a cylindrical nozzle (a pipe) thus two circular synthetic jets in phase opposition are obtained. The influence of jets interaction has been evaluated by varying the jet-axes-distance (1.1, 3 and 5 nozzle diameters) at a fixed operating condition (Reynolds number equal to 6700 and Strouhal number equal to 0.046); the jets pulsating frequency is kept equal to the sub-cavities resonance frequency and the results are compared with those of the single circular synthetic jet in the same conditions. The flow is characterized with PIV phase averaged measurements. Results for the single synthetic jet are in good agreement with the ones present in the literature and a potential core region is defined for the phase averaged flow field of synthetic jets. Twin circular synthetic jets at jet-axes-distance equal to 3 and 5 diameters show the same behavior with respect to the single circular synthetic jet. Differently, strong interaction effects are seen at jet-axes-distance equal to 1.1 diameters: in particular a double vortex ring structure is visualized. This causes a different velocity distribution in the jet core, higher axial velocities and a lower jet width.

T2  - Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering
AB  - Previous empirical models of propped fracture conductivity are based either on data sourced from single investigations or on data not in the public domain. In this work, statistically rigorous models of propped fracture conductivity are developed using a database of fracture conductivity experiments reported in technical literature over the last 40 years. The database contains about 2700 data points. Propped fracture conductivity is the dependent variable and proppant type, mesh size, proppant concentration, formation hardness, closure stress, formation temperature, and polymer concentration are the independent variables. The full, original database was pared down to various subsets, each having complete information in relation to some subset of the independent variables. The number of independent variables included in each of the resulting databases varied from three to six. Seventy percent of the data was used to develop the models while thirty percent of the data was used to validate them. Fixed effect models were selected using all subsets regression analysis in three, four, and five experimental factors for each of two types of proppant. The five factor model appeared to be the most useful model for both proppant types from a predictive point of view. Five-factor model predictions also compared favorably with an existing propped fracture conductivity model and different case histories published in literature. This project provides engineers with access to a propped fracture conductivity database based on experiments reported over the past 40 years in technical literature. The models developed based on this database can be used to generate predictions of propped fracture conductivity for a variety of proppant characteristics and formation conditions. Also, the models presented here are based on data from experimental investigations in different laboratories, potentially reducing biases that may be present in single laboratory investigations.

AB  - Vibration induced by external excitations such as earthquake or mechanical operation is a threat to the safety of PB-FHR. A scaled model based on TMSR-SF is built to conduct vibration experiments under different conditions. Experiment results show that pebble bed keeps stable under weak vibration, while it becomes denser in few minutes when strong vibration occurs. The packing factor increases rapidly with about 5% variation in initial 5 min under strong vibration, which induces approximately 2500 pcm reactivity in reactor core. The vertical vibration which occurs first in earthquake has less impact on pebble bed than horizontal vibration. Increase of flow velocity may enhance support force between pebbles, which leads to more stable structure of pebble bed under vibration. The study analyzed the influence of vibration on the pebble bed in the reactor core. These experiment phenomena and results provide support to reactor design and safety analysis of PB-FHR.

AB  - This work presents the results of an experimental study and thermodynamic study of solar drying of tomatoes of the KAWA type, where the drying experiments was carried out in a large scale mixed solar dryer. The aim is to obtain the drying curves and calculate the effective diffusivity to predict drying kinetics and thermodynamic characteristics of tomatoes drying. The tomato samples were cut in two different shapes namely flat slices and wedges. In the case of flat slices, there were four different thicknesses, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 cm. For the wedged slices, the tomatoes was slit into 2, 4, 8 and 16 equal sections. The moisture content of the tomatoes varied between 92.5 and 93.6%. The tomatoes were weighed regularly until moisture content fell between 18 and 25%. The Fick’s diffusion equation was used to calculate the effective diffusivity from the experimental data by fitting a linear dependency. A new proposed approach from the Arrhenius equation and a literature model were used to determine thermodynamic parameters. The drying operation lasted from 5 h to 21.25 h for flat slices and 8.5 h to 28.25 h for the wedges. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the new proposed approach are compared with the literature model. Evidently, the Gibbs free energy values indicate that tomato solar drying is a spontaneous natural process.

T2  - Coastal Engineering
AB  - One of the key aspects of breakwater design and safety assessment is their stability evaluation. In the present paper, hydraulic stability of a multi-layer berm breakwater (MLBB) has been studied through varying the parameter of eroded area. To this end, a 2-D experimental model has been carried out in the wave flume of Tarbiat Modares University using irregular waves with a JONSWAP spectrum. A total of 150 tests have been performed to cover a wide range of sea state conditions and geometrical parameters such as wave height, wave period, water depth, berm width, berm elevation, stone class I height, front slope and nominal diameter of stone class I. In this study, a new dimensionless parameter is introduced to indicate that the wave breaking type plays a fundamental role in stability of MLBBs. Eventually; a new formula is derived to estimate the damage of MLBBs, based on different sea state conditions and various geometrical parameters. Comparisons are made between the estimated damage parameter of MLBBs by the proposed formula and those estimated by existing formulae. The results denote that the present formula not only performs well for MLBBs experimental data, but also indicates a reliable performance for some of Lykke Andersen's (2006) data in statically homogenous berm breakwaters (HBBs) outside the range of given formula. Furthermore, an innovative approach is presented to examine the eroded area based on the berm recession and the intersection point of reshaped and initial profile from SWL, which performs faultlessly rather than the existing one.

AB  - The laminar liquid film falling on a horizontal smooth tube is studied numerically. The instantaneous hydrodynamic characteristics of falling film flow, the importance of surface tension in calculation and the effects of film flow rate, tube diameter, liquid distributor height and inlet liquid temperature on the flow field and film thickness are elucidated. The results indicate that: (1) The surface tension is important in the calculations of falling film flow on a horizontal tube; (2) The film falling on a circular tube has obvious instantaneous behaviors; (3) The film thickness increases with increase of film flow rate, while decreases with increase of the tube diameter, liquid distributor height and liquid temperature, respectively; (4) The film distribution along the peripheral angle is unsymmetrical, and the minimum thickness appears in 110–150° of peripheral angle depending on the working conditions. Furthermore, new correlations of falling film thickness on a horizontal tube based on the present data are established, which fit 97% of 84 data in θ = 2–15° within ±20%, 90% of 632 data in θ = 15–165° within ±20%, and 73% of 112 data in θ = 165–178° within ±30%.

A k-ɛ turbulence model is used to perform the transient simulations. The 3-D numerical predictions are based on the time averaged Spalart-Allmaras equations. A case study is performed for varying VAWT stator vane (tab) geometries of a Zephyr vertical axis wind turbine. The mean velocity is used to predict the time averaged variations of the power coefficient and power output. Power coefficients predicted by the numerical models are compared for different turbine geometries. The predictive capabilities of the numerical model are verified by past experimental data, as well as wind tunnel experiments in the current paper, to compare two particular geometric designs. The numerical results examine the turbine's performance at constant and variable rotor velocities. The effects of stator vanes on the turbine's power output are presented and discussed.

T2  - Applied Thermal Engineering
AB  - In this paper, the direct contact heat transfer is investigated experimentally for a helium gas at 90 °C injected through a slurry of water at 22 °C and alumina solid particles in a slurry bubble column reactor. This work examines the effects of superficial gas velocity, static liquid height, solid particles concentration and solid particle size, on the volumetric heat transfer coefficient and slurry temperature of the slurry bubble column reactor. These effects are formulated in forms of empirical equations. From the experimental work, it is found that the volumetric heat transfer coefficient and the slurry temperature increase by increasing the superficial gas velocity with a higher rate of increase at lower superficial gas velocity. In addition, the volumetric heat transfer coefficient and the slurry temperature decrease by increasing the static liquid height and/or the solid concentration at any given superficial gas velocity. Furthermore, it is found that the rate of decrease of the volumetric heat transfer coefficient with the solid concentration is approximately the same for different superficial gas velocities, and the decrease of the slurry temperature with the solid concentration is negligible.

AB  - This paper presents a method to determine the Drucker–Prager parameters of pressure-dependant elastic-perfectly plastic polymeric materials by means of the depth-sensing indentation technique. This is achieved via an inverse analysis of the load–displacement data resulting from two tests performed with Berkovich and spherical tips. The well-posedness and the effective range of application of the proposed method are carefully assessed first. Then the method is tested for two elasto-plastic materials with mild initial strain-hardening (HDPE and PMMA), and the results are compared to those measured using conventional tensile and compression tests. It is found that the pressure-sensitivity indices can be accurately predicted, while the yield stress predictions in tension and compression fall within the non-linear portion of the uniaxial stress–strain curves, i.e., inside the region where plastic deformation begins.

AB  - A comprehensive study was performed to examine the flow characteristics over rectangular sharp-crested side weirs based on the traditional weir equation. To obtain a generally convenient discharge coefficient relationship, series of experiments were conducted according to manipulation of different prevailing parameters. The flow regime was consistently subcritical for upstream Froude numbers ranging from 0.08 to 0.91. Furthermore, experimental data sets of the former investigators were also applied. In order to identify the most important parameters affecting the discharge coefficient of rectangular sharp-crested side weirs, a sensitivity analysis was carried out based upon an artificial neural network modeling. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicated the Froude number to be the most influential parameter on discharge coefficient. Accordingly, a power equation is derived for estimating the discharge coefficient, which is applicable for both sub- and supercritical flow conditions simultaneously. Moreover, considering all the influential parameters, a nonlinear correlation was obtained with the highest precision to determine the discharge coefficient of sharp-crested rectangular side weirs.

T2  - Annals of Nuclear Energy
AB  - Radioactive tank waste is scheduled for vitrification at the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) being constructed at the Hanford Site. Testing of the pilot-scale DuraMelter 1200 at the Vitreous State Laboratory at the Catholic University of America has demonstrated that bubbling increases the melt rate of the batch material, and as a result, melter throughput. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of this pilot-scale waste glass melter are being developed to improve our understanding of the processes that occur within the melter to aid in process optimization and troubleshooting of the WTP melters. Unfortunately, model validation is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining suitable experimental data for operational melters due to the inaccessibility for direct observation and measurements of the high-temperature, opaque fluid through the water-jacketed, refractory-lined steel vessel. This study focuses on assessing the fidelity of the CFD models to accurately predict the bubbling behavior. Because of the paucity of experimental data at the resolution required for CFD validation, a code comparison was used to evaluate two common approaches for simulating flows of two immiscible Newtonian fluids on numerical grids and resolving multiphase interfaces. Here, the volume of fluid and level set methods are used to resolve the dynamically evolving interfaces between the molten glass and the air bubbles. To aid in the validation of the results of these codes, a comparison of the bubble behavior, growth, and frequency of bubble generation are presented and a grid convergence study is performed for the two approaches. The predictions from the two codes are within 6% for the average bubble radius of curvature within the bubble channels, within 2% for average terminal rise velocity of the bubbles, and within 4% for the area mean of the local maxima at the free surface. These parameters are of interest since they affect the convection within the melter and at the interface between the glass and batch layer. Ultimately, the results of this work can assist in confirming the predictive ability of waste glass melter models and provide a better understanding of the flow patterns within the WTP melters.

AB  - The breakup process has been investigated by single drop experiments in a stirred liquid–liquid tank. The time taken to deform, stretch and produce two or more fragments was measured. For each of the observed breakup events, the number of drops in the resulting population was registered. The occurrence of equal and unequal breakup events was also noticed. Four oil-in-water systems were studied: toluene, petroleum, n-dodecane, and octanol. The mean energy dissipation rate of the tank was 1.14m2/s3 and the diameter of the observed mother drops that breakup were mainly in the range of 1–4mm. Multiple breakup events were the most frequent outcome in the experiments. It was observed that the number of daughter drops produced in a breakup was dependent on the mother drop size. The breakup time increased with the mother drop size and was in the approximate range of 10–100ms. A large uncertainty in the measurements is associated with the determination of the final breakup time, particularly in the cases of high order breakup events. Most breakup events took place in the large velocity field close to the radial impeller. It is not evident whether the breakup events were due to the time average shear or pressure and velocity fluctuations.

AB  - Taylor bubble velocity in slug flow is a closure relation which significantly affects the prediction of liquid holdup (or void fraction) and pressure gradient in mechanistic models of slug flow for oil and gas pipe applications. In this work, we use a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach to simulate the motion of Taylor bubbles in pipes; the interface is tracked with a Level-Set method implemented in a commercial code. A large numerical database is generated covering the most ample range of fluid properties and pipe inclination angles explored to date (Eo ∈ [10, 700], Mo∈[1×10−6,5×103], andθ ∈ [0°, 90°]). A unified Taylor bubble rise velocity correlation is extracted from that database. The new correlation predicts the numerical database with 8.6% absolute average relative error and a coefficient of determination R2=0.97, and other available experimental data with 13.0% absolute average relative error and R2=0.84 outperforming existing correlations and models.

AB  - This study experimentally investigates the effects of pore density, inlet velocity and blockage ratio on fluid flow behaviour and pressure drop in channels partially filled with a metal foam block. The fluid velocities in the free stream region, which is a clear (from foam) region on the top of foam block, are measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and hot-wire anemometry. The metal foam data are compared to those of solid blocks with the same size. For low blockage ratios, i.e. thin foam layers, the pressure drop caused by a solid block is higher than that of the foam when tested under identical conditions. Interestingly, nonetheless, beyond a threshold blockage ratio value, the pressure drop induced by the metal foam block exceeds that of the solid block of the same height tested at the same air flow rate. This behaviour is best described as the interplay between resistance caused by blockage versus that of the wake forms downstream and over the objects and additional frictional effects within the porous region and on the interface. Furthermore, a correlation, with ±16% deviation, is developed to predict the flow resistance caused by the solid and foam blocks across the partially filled channel.

AB  - This paper presents a new metamodel form and associated construction procedure adapted to the sizing tasks of mechatronics systems. This method of meta-modeling uses scaling laws to extract compact forms of design models from local numerical simulations (FEM). Compared to traditional metamodels (polynomial response surfaces, kriging, radial basis function) the scaling-law-based metamodels have the advantage of a light, compact form and good predictive accuracy over a wide range of the design variables (several orders of magnitude). The general regression process is first explained and then illustrated on different examples: a purely numerical test function, a limited angle electromagnetic actuator and a flexible mechanical hinge.

AB  - Millions of off-grid homes in remote areas around the world have access to pico-hydro (5 kW or less) resources that are undeveloped due to prohibitive installed costs ($/kW). The Turgo turbine, a hydroelectric impulse turbine generally suited for medium to high head applications, has gained renewed attention in research due to its potential applicability to such sites. Nevertheless, published literature about the Turgo turbine is limited and indicates that current theory and experimental knowledge do not adequately explain the effects of certain design parameters, such as nozzle diameter, jet inlet angle, number of blades, and blade speed on the turbine's efficiency. In this study, these parameters are used in a three-level (34) central composite response surface experiment. A low-cost Turgo turbine is built and tested from readily available materials and a second order regression model is developed to predict its efficiency as a function of each parameter above and their interactions. The effects of blade orientation angle and jet impact location on efficiency are also investigated and experimentally found to be of relatively little significance to the turbine. The purpose of this study is to establish empirical design guidelines that enable small hydroelectric manufacturers and individuals to design low-cost efficient Turgo Turbines that can be optimized to a specific pico-hydro site. The results are also expressed in dimensionless parameters to allow for potential scaling to larger systems and manufacturers.

AB  - Motivated by recent advances in material design methods that allow for the controlled engineering of microstructure, we study how the degree of spatial ordering of the inclusions within a particle composite will affect the stress intensity factor associated with an existing crack. By exploring statistically representative sets of random inclusions using linear elastic fracture mechanics expressions, trends of the particle arrangement effect on the stress intensity factor are observed. We find that ordered, random, and clumped inclusion arrangements show an increasing effect on toughness, in that order. These results are verified using finite element analysis. To quantify the observed trend in material behavior with the spatial order of inclusions we consider two metrics of order: the bond-orientational order parameter, Q, and the translational order parameter, T. Finite element models of particle composites with increasing degrees of order reveal that the increasing effect on toughness can be captured and that T is more closely correlated to the effect on the stress intensity factor. We also find that the correlation between the stress intensity factor and particle arrangement is sensitive to the nearest-neighbor distance in Q, revealing that a quantifier approaching a global measure of order is more representative depending on the inclusion volume fraction. The results of this work can improve our understanding of how the stress intensity factor in particle composites explicitly varies with inclusion arrangement. It also provides key insights to develop formulations to engineer random composite microstructures for improved material fracture integrity and to identify issues in quality control of manufacturing methods involving particle distribution.
