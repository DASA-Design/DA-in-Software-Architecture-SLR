Chuah","AI-Assisted Framework for Green-Routing and Load Balancing in Hybrid Software-Defined Networking: Proposal, Challenges and Future Perspective","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022291","","The explosive growth of IP networks, the advent of cloud computing, and the rapid progress in wireless communications witnessed today reflect significant progress towards meeting the explosive data traffic demands. Consequently, communications service providers should deploy efficient and intelligent network solutions to accommodate the huge traffic demands and to ease the capacity pressure on their network infrastructure. Besides, vendors should develop novel energy-efficient networks to reduce network utility costs and carbon footprint. Software-defined networking (SDN) provides a suitable solution, however, complete SDN deployment is currently unachievable in the short-term. An alternative is the hybrid SDN/open shortest path forwarding (OSPF) network, which allows the deployment of SDN in legacy networks. Nevertheless, hybrid SDN/OSPF also faces several technical, economic and organizational challenges. Although many energy-efficiency routing solutions exist in hybrid SDN/OSPF networks, they are generic and reactive by design. Moreover, these solutions are characterized by manual control plane forwarding configurations, leading to sub-optimal performance. The recent promising combination of SDN and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in traffic management and control provides tremendous opportunities. In this paper, we first provide a review of the most recent optimization approaches for global energy-efficient routing and load balancing. Next, we investigate a scalable and intelligent integrated architectural framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to realize predictive and rate adaptive energy-efficient routing with guaranteed quality of service (QoS), in transitional hybrid SDN/OSPF networks. Based on the need to minimize global network energy consumption and improve link performance, this paper provides key research insights into the current progress in hybrid SDN/OSPF, ML and AI in the hope of stimulating more research.","2020","2025-07-09 04:16:11","2025-07-11 08:11:15","","166384-166441","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; Communication networks; deep reinforcement learning; energy-aware routing; Heuristic algorithms; Hybrid SDN/OSPF; Load management; machine learning; Machine learning; Optimization; quality of service; Quality of service; Routing; scalable; traffic engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proença","Fast Defense System Against Attacks in Software Defined Networks","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878576","","With the ever-growing data traffic in computer networks nowadays, the management of large-scale networks is a challenge for guaranteeing the quality of the provided services. This is due to the increasingly usage of connected applications, such as Internet of Things and cloud computing environments. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that aims to make this management process easier by centralizing the configuration of all network devices into a single programmable central controller. However, as any centralized service, this architecture is susceptible to security vulnerabilities, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and port scan attacks. Thus, security methods are necessary to guarantee the normal operation of SDN's central controller. Furthermore, networks are transporting an increasingly amount of information day by day, which could mean data loss in case of long network unavailability. For this reason, security mechanisms must operate online, with fast-responding countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the detected attacks over the SDN. In this paper, we present a fast SDN defense system against DDoS and port scan attacks, which runs directly into the central controller and uses a game theoretical approach for attack mitigation. For the detection, we compare three different approaches, particle swarm optimization, multi-layer perceptron neural network, and discrete wavelet transform. We test our approach over IP flow data generated over Mininet network emulator, along with floodlight controller, and the presented defense system achieved good outcomes for both detection and mitigation processes.","2018","2025-07-09 04:16:11","2025-07-11 08:11:14","","69620-69639","","","6","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Computer crime; DDoS; Discrete wavelet transforms; DWT; Internet of Things; IP networks; MLP; port scan; PSO; SDN; Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software-defined network (SDN) is an emergent paradigm that aims to support next-generation networks through its flexible and powerful management mechanisms. One of the biggest threats faced by these services nowadays is security management. Attacks based on the denial of service (DoS) are particularly efficient against this paradigm due to its centralized control characteristic. Once this controlling system receives a massive amount of malicious requests, the overall performance of the network operation is impaired. Although several researches propose to address this problem, most of them are reactive approaches, detecting the attacks and warning the network administrators, i.e., after the network is already compromised. This paper presents an autonomic DoS/DDoS defensive approach for SDNs called Game Theory (GT)-Holt-Winters for Digital Signature (HWDS), which unites the anomaly detection and identification provided by an HWDS system with an autonomous decision-making model based on GT. Real collected data and simulated attacks are used by the system to measure its effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we also use a heuristic Fuzzy-GADS method for anomaly detection instead of HWDS, aiming to compare the achieved performance and evaluate the behavior of the presented game theoretical approaches a standalone mitigation module.","2017","2025-07-09 04:16:11","2025-07-11 08:11:13","","9485-9496","","","5","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer crime; denial of service; fuzzy logic; Fuzzy logic; GADS; Game theory; Games; Genetic algorithms; HWDS; IP networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite notable progress, UWB algorithms from the scientific literature are often evaluated in isolation in very specific conditions and hence difficult to compare. This paper introduces a novel benchmark platform designed to assess the performance of 11 prominent UWB accuracy-enhancing algorithms, both independently and in combination. A key feature of the platform is its incorporation of multiple diverse evaluation metrics, including mean average error, latency, and spatial error. We showcase the significance of adopting alternative metrics such as spatial error, which often, depending on the use case, offers greater relevance than the prevalently used mean average error. Furthermore, we show that “more is better” does not hold true when combining multiple accuracy-improving algorithms for UWB systems: combining multiple accuracy-improving algorithms reveals instances of diminishing returns and can even result in overall performance decline. Additionally, we caution against blind reliance on accuracy outcomes reported in the scientific literature when designing UWB systems for use cases that are different in terms of requirements or environment. Finally, we also provide algorithmic recommendations for distinct surroundings, exemplary applications, and usage contexts, assisting in driving efficient design in future UWB research and adoption.","2024","2025-07-09 04:18:06","2025-07-11 08:11:11","","16881-16901","","","12","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Benchmark; Benchmark testing; filters; Global Positioning System; guidelines; Guidelines; localization; Location awareness; LOS/NLOS; software; Ultra wideband technology; ultra-wideband; UWB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since they are large and spread over wide geographical areas, it is inevitable that failures will occur. Various generation and transmission disturbances, such as generator and transmission line tripping and load disconnection, give rise to a mismatch between generation and demand, which manifest as frequency events. These events can take the form of negligible frequency deviations or more severe emergencies that can precipitate cascading outages, depending on the severity of the disturbance and efficacy of remedial action schema. The impacts of such events have become more critical recently due to increased levels of renewable penetration and distributed energy resources, which have caused a decline in system synchronous inertia. Due to the repercussions, it is indispensable to arrest such disturbances on time by activating primary frequency control measures. In this paper, a comprehensive systematic literature review is presented on the techniques used for event detection in power systems and the methods of primary frequency response in modern power systems. The paper also highlights the impacts of severe frequency events within power systems.","2022","2025-07-09 04:18:07","2025-07-11 08:11:18","","61494-61519","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","event detection; Event detection; frequency control; Frequency control; Frequency measurement; low inertia power systems; power blackouts; Power system disturbance; Power system dynamics; Power systems; Reliability; systematic literature review; Systematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) capture brain images. MRI is pivotal in diagnosing brain tumors and analyzing other brain disorders. Typically, radiologists or experts manually assess MRI images to detect brain tumors and abnormalities in the early stages for appropriate treatment. However, early brain tumor diagnosis is complex, necessitating computerized methods. This research introduces a novel approach for the automated segmentation of brain tumors and a framework for classifying brain tumor regions. The proposed methods comprise several stages: preprocessing, enhancing the coherence of MRI brain images using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and diffusion filtering in the first two steps, followed by the segmentation of the region of interest using the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering technique in the third step. The last step involves classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classifier is applied to different brain tumor types, from meningioma to pituitary tumors, utilizing the CE-MRI database. The proposed method exhibits significantly improved contrast and proves the effectiveness of the classification framework, achieving an average sensitivity of 0.977, specificity of 0.979, accuracy of 0.982, and a Dice score (DSC) of 0.961. Furthermore, this method demonstrates a shorter processing time of 0.42 seconds compared to existing approaches. The performance of this method underscores its significance when compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and DSC. For future enhancements, it is possible to standardize the approach by incorporating a set of classifiers to increase the robustness of the brain classification method.","2024","2025-07-09 04:18:07","2025-07-11 08:11:16","","61312-61335","","","12","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brain; Brain tumor; classification; Computed tomography; contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization; diffusion filtering; Fuzzy C-Means; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pipelines; segmentation; support vector machine; Support vector machines; Tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
