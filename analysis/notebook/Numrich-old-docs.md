| RD-04 | *The Computational Energy Spectrum of a Program as It Executes*(2010)                        | Proposes the concept of a “computational energy spectrum” to analyse fluctuations in program performance over time.               | Extends Numrich's "Principle of Computational Least Action" to model variability in performance using physics-inspired analogies. | Lacks explicit dimensional analysis procedures or modeling via dimensionless numbers; remains metaphorical and not empirically validated for DA. |
| RD-08 | *A Metric Space for Computer Programs and the Principle of Computational Least Action*(2008) | Defines a metric space to compare software programs using action-based distance metrics inspired by classical mechanics.            | Philosophical extension of the action principle to software comparison but does not apply or develop core DA techniques.          | Highly abstract; does not formulate or apply standard DA frameworks or dimensionless modeling methods.                                           |
| RD-09 | *A Performance Model with a Fixed Point for a Molecular Dynamics Kernel*(2009)               | Develops a fixed-point model for performance prediction in molecular dynamics simulations.                                          | Builds on computational action ideas but focuses on performance modeling of specific numerical codes.                             | While quantitative, it does not explore or apply DA methods or Pi-theorem-type modeling.                                                         |
| RD-10 | *A Metric Space for Productivity Measurement in Software Development*(2005)                  | Proposes a method to quantify programmer productivity using action-based metrics and time-stamped compiler data.                    | Applies computational action metaphor to software productivity rather than performance or architecture metrics.                   | Does not implement dimensional analysis or derive dimensionless quantities for modeling.                                                         |
| RD-11 | *Performance Metrics Based on Computational Action*(2004)                                    | Introduces “computational action” as a performance metric and advocates minimizing wasted action to improve computing efficiency. | Foundational paper proposing the action metric; influential for later Numrich work.                                               | Lays conceptual groundwork but does not integrate DA explicitly or construct dimensionless models.                                               |

## 🔍 Rationale

These documents collectively represent Robert W. Numrich’s broader theoretical work on computational action and physics-inspired analogies in software performance. While they explore innovative metrics such as energy spectra, action norms, and metric spaces for program comparison, they do not explicitly apply Dimensional Analysis techniques such as the Pi theorem, dimensional matrices, or the formulation of dimensionless groups. As a result, they fall outside the core focus of the SLR, which centers on explicit, validated use of dimensional analysis methods in software development and architecture. Therefore, despite their conceptual contributions, these documents were not included in the final SLR.
