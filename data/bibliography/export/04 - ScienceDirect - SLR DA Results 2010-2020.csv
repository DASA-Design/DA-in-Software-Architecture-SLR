Cutting removal is, however, affected by different parameters including fluid flow rate, drill pipe rotation, cutting size and inclination which have to be considered simultaneously. In the current report, Liquid-Solid model is implemented to solve the governing equations in the Eulerian CFD framework. Results are compared with experimental data and successful validation with experimental data is achieved. On the basis of design of experiment algorithm, further simulations have been carried out to investigate the effect of the as mentioned key parameters on cutting transport behavior. Results show that hole inclinations between 45 and 60° are the most difficult angles in hole cleaning process. Moreover, increase in values of flow rate and drill pipe rotation will effectively improve the drag effects leading to superior cutting removal. Besides, it has been proven that cutting size affects cutting transport less than the other parameters. For industrial applications, an empirical correlation is developed for estimating cutting concentration. Buckingham-π theorem along with multi-variable regression technique is applied to establish the correlation.","2016-08-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:15:27","","670-679","","","34","","Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computational fluid dynamic; Cutting transport; Hole cleaning; Hole inclination; Pipe rotation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to investigate the seismic performance of the CPR1000 prestressed concrete containment vessel (PCCV) structure under design and beyond-design basis earthquake, a 1/20 scale concrete containment vessel (CCV) model was designed and constructed on the shaking table based on the similitude requirements from the Buckingham's π-Theorem. The horizontal and vertical earthquake waves generated from RG1.60 spectrum were selected as the input earthquake waves in the shaking table model test, and the earthquake waves with peak ground acceleration (PGA) 0.2g, 0.3g, 0.4g, 0.5g, 0.7g, 0.9g and 1.2g respectively were loaded step by step until the macroscopic failure occurred in the model containment vessel. The dynamic responses of the model CCV were obtained from the acceleration sensors and resistance strain gages. The model test results showed that the maximum acceleration magnification factor of the model CCV was 1.974 with PGA of 0.2g, which indicated that the CCV had a good seismic-resistant behavior under 0.2g earthquake. Until the second last test case with the horizontal peak earthquake motion of 0.9g (corresponding to 0.9g for the prototype structure), the fundamental frequency of the model CCV only decreased slightly and the maximum tensile strains at all monitoring points were much smaller than the ultimate tensile strain. It meant that the model CCV as a whole was within the elastic range. In the last case (1.2g), the model fundamental frequency decreased steeply. At the same time, the maximum tensile strains at the heel of the cylinder wall far exceeded the ultimate tensile strain and a circle of cracks occurred at the cylinder wall heel. It meant rupture failure had occurred and the cylinder wall heel of the CCV was the weak region. It agreed well with the numerical analysis results and the visual inspection and camera record at the test site. Although a circle of concrete cracks appeared around the cylinder wall foot, the model CCV still remained integral as a whole and neither cracking parts dislocation nor collapse occurred. Because the test model was a plain concrete structure and the model test results should be conservative estimation, it can be concluded that the prototype PCCV for CPR1000 nuclear power plant had sufficient seismic safety margin.","2016-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:30:13","","186-204","","","93","","Progress in Nuclear Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Containment vessel; Nuclear power plant; Seismic performance; Shaking table test; Similarity law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The B&M nomograms were applied to the three Jack Rabbit II (JR II) chlorine release trials being used for the multi-model comparison described in other papers in this special issue. The intent was to use the B&M model as a baseline against which other, more sophisticated models, could be compared. In any model applied to the JR II trials, it is important to properly initialize the cloud characteristics (geometry, density, etc.). The B&M handbook has a simple basic thermodynamics method to calculate the initial size and density of a cloud released as a two-phase pure mixture. It is shown that the B&M nomograms’ predictions of arc maximum concentration (arc max C) for JR II trials 1, 6, and 7 have skill about in the middle of the group of 17 models that are being compared. The B&M predictions are relatively unbiased for Trials 6 and 7 (which has the largest arc max C), but overpredict by a factor of 2 or 3 for Trial 1.

The outflow temperature was the result of the interaction among temperature field, flow field and artificial regulation. To characterize them, three influencing factors (i.e., temperature distribution, outflow rate and submerged depth) were chosen. Experiments were conducted to investigate the response of outflow temperature to influencing factors in a nonlinearly stratified fluid with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Results showed that the withdrawal layer was formed near the level of floating intake inhibited by the density gradient, and its thickness was proportional to stratification intensity. The withdrawal layer ascended with the decrease in submerged depth, and the thickness also changed due to the variation in density gradient. Although the outflow temperature increased, the variation amplitude depended on the temperature gradient between the two submerged depths. However, enlarging the outflow rate within a certain range had relatively small influence on the withdrawal layer thickness and the outflow temperature. Considering the experimental results, a formula was developed for predicting the outflow temperature based on dimensional analysis and energy conservation.","2019-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:31:23","","109893","","","109","","Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Floating intake; Nonlinearly stratified reservoir; Outflow temperature; PIV; Selective withdrawal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A subset of these collectors is collectors that are integrated into building envelope. The so-called “building-integrated” PV/T collectors have seen a dramatic rise in popularity recently. This recent popularity has necessitated systematic design optimization. To benefit design optimization, a review of computer models of these collectors was performed. This review was performed by objectively assessing international findings on roof-integrated and curtain-wall integrated PV/T collectors. The scope of this review was thermal collection efficiency. The significance of this review was to identify the weakest link in computer models that should one day lead to more accurate computer models. This weak link is the internal heat transfer rate. To overcome this weakness, a model calibration method was proposed that is based on case-by-case parameter identification. In addition, a detailed dimensional analysis was performed that allowed a new Π group to be introduced to Nusselt (Nu) number correlations of developing, turbulent parallel-plate flow. This Π group is the Stanton number as applied to the inter-channel radiative heat transfer coefficient (Str). Commonly implemented Nu number correlations do not account for this heat transfer rate. They only account for collector geometry, collector air flow inertia and collector air viscosity.","2016-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:28:29","","102-117","","","63","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Curtainwall; Daylighting; Dimensional analysis; Nusselt number correlations; Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector; Solar-optical properties; Thermal collection efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, such data are lacking for highly curved helixes, probably due to the difficulty to manufacture these geometries through traditional manufacturing techniques. In this paper, CFD simulations are carried out for determining the laminar flow friction factor in helical pipes, particularly highly curved ones. For an experimental validation of the numerical results, a highly curved helix was built by 3D-printing. Existing correlations are shown to fail for the accurate prediction of the friction factor in highly curved helixes. A new correlation is thus proposed.

A large set of experimental data, obtained in SCW flowing upwards in a 4-m long vertical bare tube with a 10-mm Internal Diameter (ID), was analyzed. The data were collected at pressures of about 24 MPa, inlet temperatures from 320 to 350 °C, values of mass flux ranging from 200 to 1500 kg/m2·s and heat fluxes up to 1250 kW/m2, for several combinations of wall and bulk-fluid temperatures that were below, at, or above the pseudocritical temperature. A dimensional analysis was conducted, using the Buckingham Π-theorem, to derive a general form of the empirical SCW heat-transfer correlation for the Nusselt number, which was finalized based on the experimental data obtained within the Normal Heat-Transfer (NHT) and Improved Heat-Transfer (IHT) regimes. The derived correlation showed the best fit for the experimental data within a wide range of flow conditions. This correlation has an uncertainty of about ±25% for Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) values and approximately ±15% for calculated wall temperatures. Subsequently, this correlation was used to calculate HTCs in support of preliminary thermalhydraulic calculations for HXs with SCW and SuperHeated Steam (SHS) as the operating fluids. The HXs are to be designed for integration into the No-Reheat or Single Reheat SCW Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) cycles and provide a link to support hydrogen production through the Cu–Cl cycle. Thermal energy will be transferred from the SCWR to an intermediate SHS loop operating at 5 MPa and delivered to the hydrolysis and oxygen-production process steps of the Cu–Cl cycle facility, which operates at temperatures of up to 530 °C. The analyzed HXs are of a double-pipe, counter-flow design. Calculations involved numerical solutions to identify HX outlet flow temperatures, required pipe lengths, number of pipes for each HX unit, mass flow rates and other relevant heat transfer parameters. Various test conditions have been assessed in support of a database to determine feasible configurations for an HX design.","2012-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:27:58","","16542-16556","","21","37","","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Heat transfer correlation; Nuclear-based hydrogen co-generation; SuperCritical water; Thermochemical Copper-Chlorine cycle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pressing environmental and societal problems require an understanding of how processes operate at different scales, and how they can be linked across scales. Soil science as many other disciplines obtain the bulk of their empirical information at fine scales, whereas results of environmental diagnostics, monitoring, and predictions are needed to make important policy decisions at much larger scales. It becomes imperative to relate the information that is available and produced at different scales. The objective of this work is to present an overview of concepts that are currently used to define and relate scales in soil studies. The paper is not intended to be a compendium, but rather should be viewed as material for discussion, reference, and critique. It discusses definitions and terminology, including general approaches of scale problems in environmental studies that are applicable to soils, including hierarchies, measurement metrics, similitude, non-geometric scale metrics, and notions of upscaling and downscaling. Concepts of general scaling methods and theories are dimensional analysis, power law scaling, space and time dependent scaling. A section on spatiotemporal patterns introduces scaling ideas that were used in soil studies such as empirical orthogonal functions, data assimilation, and cumulative distribution function matching. Reviewed scaling methods developed specifically to soil studies include geometric similitude of pore spaces, scaling with Richards equation, scale dependencies of water and solute flux model parameters, scaling based on temporal stability, overland flow and sediment transport as the scaling phenomenon, and the relevance of scaling to pedotransfer functions. An outlook for scaling research in soils is presented that shows the needs of additional research and the feasibility of using scaling to enrich and advance soil research to help face the grand challenges of modern times.","2017-02-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:29:05","","4-30","","","287","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimension analysis; Hierarchy; Measurement metrics; Power law; Similitude; Spatiotemporal data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance of a given film cooling design, and thus the life of the cooled part, is dependent on the scenario parameters that define the environment in which it operates, including Reynolds and Mach numbers, upstream boundary layer and turbulence characteristics, blowing ratio, density ratio, pressure gradient, surface curvature, etc. Of these, one parameter that has received relatively little attention in the open literature is Mach number. This work evaluates the role of Mach number in shaped-hole film cooling performance by comparing results of two large eddy simulations of a plenum-fed 7-7-7 hole cooling a flat plate at freestream Mach numbers of 0.25 and 0.5, with all other relevant scenario parameters fixed. This comparison shows important differences between the two cases. To begin, the performance, as measured by laterally-averaged adiabatic effectiveness, is dramatically different, with the high Mach case performing up to 50% worse. This decrease in performance at high Mach is due to the coolant jet separating from the surface and a large scale oscillation that leads to significant asymmetry in the time-averaged flow, features which are absent in the low Mach case. These changes appear to be caused by changes to the flow in the cooling hole, which is also asymmetric in the high Mach case. This asymmetry leads to entrainment of hot gas into the hole on one side. Further, in the high Mach case, the flow in the hole is mildly supersonic and has sequence of weak shocks, which are, of course, absent in the low Mach scenario.","2019-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:28:53","","498-517","","","140","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when attempting to avoid these risks, food-processing plants frequently tend to clean for too long, at extremely high temperatures, or with too many chemicals, resulting in high cleaning costs and severe environmental impacts. Therefore, the optimization of cleaning processes in the food industry has significant economic and ecological potential. Unfortunately, in-situ assessments of cleaning processes are difficult, and the multitude of different cleaning situations complicates the definition of a comprehensive approach. In this study, two methodological approaches for the comprehensive modeling of cleaning processes are introduced. The resulting models facilitate comparisons of different cleaning processes and they can be scaled up for processes with similar conditions, using cleaning time as a response. A dimensional analysis is performed to obtain general results and to allow transfer of the approaches to other cleaning situations. The models are established according to the statistical rules for the deduction of multiple regression equations for the prediction of the response based on the input parameters. The terms of the model equation are confirmed with a significance analysis. A machine learning approach is also used to create model equations with symbolic regression. Both methods and the obtained model equations are validated. The two applied approaches reveal similar significant terms and models. Significant dimensionless numbers are the Reynolds number, the density number that describes the ratio of the density of the soil to the density of the cleaning agent, and the soil number, which is a new dimensionless number that characterizes the properties of food soils. The methodology of both approaches is transparent; therefore, the resulting equations can be compared and similarities are found. Both methods are deemed applicable for the computational modeling of cleaning processes in food industry.","2020-04-06","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:17:27","","106733","","","135","","Computers & Chemical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cleaning process; Dimensional analysis; Food industry; Machine learning; Statistical analysis; Symbolic regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important parameter in the design of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems is the wetted pattern of soil area in the up and down wetted areas of drippers. Accurate estimation of the up and down wetted areas in surface/subsurface irrigation systems is essential for enhancing the efficiency of irrigation systems and optimal management of water resources in the field. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) and nonlinear regression (NLR) methods were used to develop equations for the estimation of the up and down wetted areas around the dripper installation position. Experiments were carried out in a transparent physical Plexiglas with dimensions of 3m×1.22m×0.5m. In this study, three different soil textures (i.e., light, medium, and heavy) were used. The drippers at four installation depths, including 0, 15, 30, and 45 cm, were evaluated. By considering an irrigation time equal to 6 h, the emitter discharge rates (i.e., 2.4, 4, and 6 L/s) were applied. Nine different variables, including soil hydraulic conductivity, emitter discharge, soil apparent density, irrigation application time, dripper installation depth, and the soil texture (i.e. amount of clay, silt and sand)were applied as inputs for the developed NLR and ANN models for estimating the up and down wetted areas of drippers. The comparison results between the measured and simulated values showed that the ANN and NLR models have appropriate performances and that the statistical error indices are within an acceptable range. The use of these models for design goals can be helpful in choosing the accurate distance between laterals and emitters as well as the suitable depth of emitters to minimize water losses via deep percolation in surface/subsurface drip irrigation. Furthermore, the results of the ANN and NLR models were compared with an experimental model (developed based on dimensional analysis (DA)) and confirmed the superiority of the ANN and NLR to DA models.","2020-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:20:17","","105767","","","178","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural networks; Drip irrigation; Nonlinear regression; Simulation; Wetted area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different hydrocyclone filters with different specifications were used to measure head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. The parameters influencing head losses were considered to be the inside diameters of the inlet and outlet pipes, cylindrical section diameter of the filter, apex diameter of the conical part, cylindrical section length of the filter, conical section length of the filter body, length of the outlet (vortex finder) pipe, water velocity in inlet pipe, acceleration of gravity, kinematic viscosity of water. A dimensional analysis was carried out, using Buckingham's pi-theorem. To develop a model, experimental head loss data from 21 filters were considered in the study.

Two experiments were performed to measure the dimensional variation of commercially available lay-flat drip irrigation pipes. A model for estimating the corresponding local head loss was developed and validated using dimensional analysis. The model was then implemented in a finite element algorithm to analyse the hydraulic performance of this type of pipes. Finally, a design example was provided. The results revealed that, for a wall thickness of 0.13 and 0.20 mm, the pipe height and width tended to be equal above a relatively low pressure, and the pipe cross-section rapidly inflated from a quasi-rectangular form to circular. For thicker walls, the equivalent diameter (four times the hydraulic radius) increased continuously with increasing pressure head but it hardly reached its nominal diameter (16 mm). The proposed model indicated that the local head loss was affected by the equivalent diameter, emitter geometry, and flow velocity. The model had high accuracy in determining the local head loss. The estimated results were in close agreement with the measured data. According to the numerical simulation, the ratio of local head loss to total loss along a pipe was up to 74.71%. The design results, when using an earlier model, demonstrated a longer maximum lateral length, since the model did not consider further contraction of the flow caused by pipe deformation. However, the model proposed here could be used in the design of systems for thin-wall lay-flat polyethylene pipes.","2020-02-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:32:52","","71-86","","","190","","Biosystems Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimensional analysis; Drip irrigation; Finite element method; Hydraulic design; Pipe deformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments are conducted in a square channel for a wide range of spray and crossflow conditions. The spatial and velocity distributions of the spray droplets for different cross-sections of the flow field in terms of different flow conditions are measured through flow visualization. Three parameters, namely, vortex vorticity, depth of vortex core, and distance between both vortex cores, are used to characterize the counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) formed by droplets. The crossflow Reynolds number, (initial atomized) droplet Reynolds number, and number of droplets injected per unit time are all found to significantly influence the features of droplets CVP. We newly define the spray-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio (J∗) based on the injected momentum flux of initial atomized droplets.

Electrospun fiber networks on the other side provide a promising environment for enhanced cell adhesion and growth due to their architecture closely mimicking the structure of the extracellular matrix present within tissues of the human body. Here, we explored the stable integration of electrospun fibers onto the surfaces of elastomeric materials to promote cytocompatibility of these composites. Elastomers based on room temperature vulcanizing silicone (RTV), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as well as functionalized PDMS-based materials were chosen as wafer substrates for attachment of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDFhfp) fibers, a well-known antithrombotic polymer. Electrospinning the fibers onto uncured interfaces acted as bonding agents on the wafers, enabling penetration and formation of a stable bond between the fibers surfaces and the elastomers after curing the interface. Dimensional analysis revealed a relationship between peeling force, intrusion depth and the elastic modulus of the wafers. A design parameter Πα was extrapolated to be used as a predictive tool of the peeling force when intrusion depth of PVDFhfp fibers and elastic modulus of the wafers are known. Cultivating fibroblasts on these hybrid membranes showed cell attachment and growth over 7 days regardless of the composition of the substrate, confirming high cytocompatibility for all composite materials. The presented approach opens avenues to establish nanofiber morphologies as a novel, stable surface texturing tool for tissue engineering, cell biology, medical devices and textiles.","2020-03-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:16:00","","110417","","","108","","Materials Science and Engineering: C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cytocompatibility; Electrospinning; Interfaces; Nanostructures; Surface texturing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fundamental and applied study of such systems is challenging as a result of the large number of thermo-fluid mechanisms governing the underlying physics. This complexity is significantly reduced by transforming the problem of interest into its scale-free form by means of dimensional analysis techniques. However, the theoretical framework of classical dimensional analysis presents the limitations of not providing a unique set of dimensionless groups, and no support for measuring the relative importance between them. In the interest of addressing these shortfalls for multiphysics turbulent flow applications, we present a semi-empirical dimensional analysis approach to efficiently extract important dimensionless groups from data obtained by means of computational (or laboratory) experiments. The methodology presented is then used to characterize important dimensionless groups in irradiated particle-laden turbulence. The study concludes that two dimensionless groups are responsible for most of the variation in the system’s thermal response, with the absorption of radiation by particles, the radiative energy deposition rate and the turbulent flow mixing the most important thermo-fluid mechanisms.

In this paper we propose a procedure based on Buckingham π-theorem to perform the scale-up of photobioreactors used to cultivate Chlorella Vulgaris fed by CO2 and wastewater rich in glycerol. This theoretical approach is usually overlooked in favor of the synergy of modeling tailored on the process and piloting, but it grants excellent generalizability. An experimental campaign at three levels was designed and carried out to evaluate the characteristic dimensionless numbers individuated by the theoretical formulation. Since scale-up regards both geometrical dimensions and type of reactor, passing from lab-scale stirred tanks (STRs) to pilot scale tubular and airlift, particular attention was devoted to defining characteristic lengths inside the dimensionless numbers. Moreover, since scale-up also regards the operating mode, scaling from discontinuous to semi-continuous to continuous, some interesting dimensionless numbers arise other than Re, Sh, DaII. They are mainly related to the type of biological process and its operating mode and are the ratios O2/CO2 and T/Topt, the ratio between the incident light intensity and the saturation constant, the absorbance, the ratio between the final and the initial concentration c/c0, the ratio between the maximum increase in cell population and its initial concentration, the ratio between the estimated specific kinetic constant and a variable representing the characteristic time of mixing inside the chosen reactor.

In this study, the ranges of air and water flow rates were set at 0.1–1.0l/min and 30.0–80.0l/min, respectively.

The volumetric mass transfer coefficient of oxygen was measured using dynamic physical absorption model. The results verified that the size of microbubble depend on air and water flow rates. The increase of the gas flow rate increased the average bubble diameter. On the other hand, the increase of the water flow rate decreased the average bubble diameter. Furthermore, the increase of water flow rate increased the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient.

However, some of those models require knowledge of geometric parameters or are only designated for radial-type pumps. In this article, dimensional analysis is used as an alternative to analyse head and flow rate degradation of different pumps without the need of any major geometric parameters. To accomplish this task, head curves for two multistage, mixed-flow type ESPs are obtained through a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program for a wide range of viscosities and different rotational speeds. The numerical head curves were compared with experimental data under equivalent operating conditions and a good agreement was found. When adequate normalisations are used together with relevant dimensionless numbers, the head values obtained from the different ESPs proved to match quite well along curves of constant specific speeds. Experimental head values from literature for a radial-type centrifugal pump with volute operating with different fluid viscosities were used to extend the present analysis for a different pump geometry. Results from this procedure turned out to match the ESPs data well. A straightforward expression to correlate head and flow rate correction factors due to viscosity follows from the present approach, thus yielding a useful tool that might help in proposing a general method to estimate performance degradation.","2017-07-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:28:46","","442-450","","","156","","Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CFD; ESP; Performance degradation; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research of models able to predict the energy consumption from the first design and energy planning phase is conducted to improve building sustainability. Use of traditional forecasting tools for building thermal energy demand tends to encounter difficulties relevant to the amount of data required, implementation of the models, computational costs and inability to generalize the output. Therefore, many studies focused on the research and development of alternative resolution methods, but the choice of the most convenient is not clear and simple. Single comparison of statistical quality indexes does not allow an adequate identification of the most efficient method, as the necessary efforts for implementation of the methods from the initial data collection to the use phase are not considered.

Such a procedure revealed ranking of the methods in four phases, namely Pre-processing, Implementation, Post-processing and Use, as well as overall assessment and selection of the most efficient method in terms of evaluated criteria.

They are commonly used for size separation of granular materials. Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, screening efficiency and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined rotating screen drum for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating screen drum equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates. The shaping effects of the rotating screen drum were evaluated from the measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics (size distribution, water content, compactness, and circularity) on wet soft agglomerates. To describe the screening efficiency parameters of a rotary screen drum, a specific method was developed by using a matrix analysis of the different measured weights of the collected products. The impacts of rotating screen drum parameters (angle of inclination, rotating speed, and product flow rate) on the sieving efficiency and on the shaping effects were investigated. The present results demonstrate high apparent screening efficiency of the rotating screen drum when used with wet agglomerates of durum wheat, ranging between 89 and 96% depending on the process conditions Finally, using dimensional analysis, two correlations were proposed on the circularity and the apparent screening efficiency whatever the operating conditions used (drum speed, angle of inclination and feed rate).","2017-02-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:15:51","","235-246","","","195","","Journal of Food Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agglomeration mechanisms; Circularity; Dimensional analysis; Durum wheat couscous; Rotating screen drum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A correlation is presented for determining the effectiveness of heat and mass transfer in a horizontal-axis, tumble-type clothes dryer drum with axial airflow. The correlation is a function of four measurable quantities: air mass flow rate, cloth mass, air mass in the drum, and the fall time experienced by a cloth falling the full height (i.e. diameter) of the drum. The Buckingham Pi Theorem is applied to the problem in order to derive dimensionless terms upon which the effectiveness depends. Empirical data from several dryers are used to derive an empirical correlation as a function of the dimensionless variables. Three cloth types were investigated, and a separate empirical correlation is proposed for each. Together, the drum effectiveness concept and the correlation presented provide a new, more accurate, computationally efficient, and readily implemented framework for modeling and simulating clothes dryers.

In this paper, the dimensional analysis and the incomplete self-similarity theory were used to deduce a model relating the volume of sediments eroded from the calanchi area to a set of geometric attributes of their tributary areas. The morphometric characteristics of 209 calanchi basins were used to calibrate and validate the model. The predictive skill of the model was assessed by calculating the mean square error and the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient. The model was found to provide a reliable prediction of eroded volume from basins entirely covered by calanchi landforms as well as from basins only partially affected by badland erosion processes. Furthermore, as the residuals between the calculated and the measured volume of the eroded material are normally distributed, the deterministic model may be considered complete, meaning that no other variables are necessary to explain the studied physical process. In other words, the model is able to predict erosion volume in calanchi landforms from a deterministic point of view.","2015-02-15","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:16:08","","292-300","","","231","","Geomorphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Badlands; Dimensional analysis; Self-similarity theory; Sicily; Soil erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a research conducted among machines that consume electricity, pumps come first with 25 %. Accurate estimation of pressure losses is a key point in order to select pump systems. Hot water from the geothermal area is carried by pipeline systems. In this study, extensive experimental study is conducted at Izmir Katip Celebi University Flow Loop using pure water for fluid temperature from 25 °C to 60 °C, for four various relative roughness values, and for Reynolds Number ranges from 6.2 × 104 to 7.8 × 105. This study has mainly two objectives: First is to identify if the absolute pipe roughness values of commercially available pipes vary according to the pipe diameter. The second objective is to investigate fluid temperature effects on frictional pressure losses in rough pipes and to present a new friction factor correlation for using in geothermal pipelines, considering the fluid temperature effects. Experimental study shows that absolute pipe roughness varies substantially for pipe diameters. The proposed friction factor has a good agreement with explicit formulas of Blasius (1913) and Taler (2016) equations for smooth pipes and Colebrook (1939) equation for rough pipes, as well as experimental data at various temperature values. Additionally, frictional pressure losses are accurately estimated using new friction factor equation. Results show that both relative roughness and temperature have a significant influence on the friction factor for turbulent flow through rough pipes. For this reason, pipe roughness should be determined correctly and the effects of fluid temperature on pressure losses should be considered. This may influence frictional head losses per unit length and, consequently, the predicted pumping requirements in geothermal pipelines.","2020-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:31:26","","101901","","","88","","Geothermics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Energy; Friction factor; Geothermal energy; Pressure loss; Rough pipe; Temperature; Turbulent flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relative movements between tool electrode and work material controls the energy penetration rate, and subsequently effects the performance characteristics. Therefore, the effect of process parameters associated with feeding motion and ECD energy are important to investigate simultaneously with respect to the performance characteristics.

Notwithstanding, the use of specialized software tools poses many challenges in regards to the retrieval of reliable and detailed information, setting a steep learning curve for engineers and energy managers. To speed up the preliminary assessment phase, it might be more convenient to resort to a simplified model that allows the evaluation of heating energy demand with a good level of accuracy and without excessive computational cost or user expertise. Dimensional analysis is a means of simplifying a physical problem by appealing to dimensional homogeneity to reduce the number of relevant variables. In this work, the authors investigated an alternative approach to assess the thermal energy demand of a high-performance-non-residential building. It was possible to define some dimensionless numbers that synthetically describe the links between the main characteristic parameters of the thermal balance by applying the Buckingham π theorem. After a detailed description of the Buckingham π theorem and of its application concerning the evaluation of the building energy balance, the authors identified nine “ad hoc” dimensionless numbers. The proposed methodology has been validated by the comparison of the heating energy demand calculated by detailed dynamic simulations carried out in TRNSYS according to the standards and laws of building energy requirements in seven different European countries. Applying a set of criteria, it was possible to employ a dimensionless number to determine, immediately and without any calculation or use of steady/dynamic software, the heating energy demand with an reliability >90%.","2017-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:16:23","","479-490","","","154","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Buckingham  theorem; Building thermal balance; Dimensionless parameters; Dynamic simulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die fill is important because it limits the productivity of tablet presses and determines key quality attributes of tablets including weight and content uniformity. Die fill occurs due to gravity and suction fill mechanisms. A model linear shoe-die filling system has been instrumented with pressure measurement devices for detailed characterisation of air pressure evolution as the powder mass is delivered in the die. Systematic experiments were carried out using a range of microcrystalline cellulose powders to explore the role of powder properties (such as particle size and bulk density) and operating parameters (such as shoe and die geometry, shoe and suction punch kinematics and powder filling level) on powder delivery. Existing models were found inadequate to describe the mass flow rate of powders under a diversity of gravity and suction filling conditions. The pressure measurements enabled the development of a new die fill model using the Buckingham Π theorem. The model includes separate terms for the contribution of the mass of powder delivered under gravity and suction fill mechanisms. The experimental procedures required to extract the parameters of the model are described. The model is applicable to the handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders where small differences in air pressure have a significant impact on the powder flow process. The practical application of the model for predicting die filling behaviour in a high-speed rotary tablet press is demonstrated by assuming operating conditions of a typical rotary tablet press. This approach can be adapted to assist formulation design and process development for operations involving handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders.","2019-05-30","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:15:49","","135-155","","","563","","International Journal of Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Die filling; Gravity filling; Powder flow; Rotary press; Suction filling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arc offsets in the synchronous and alternating phases were captured using high-speed photography and corresponding voltage and current waveforms were simultaneously recorded during the welding process. Experimental results show the arc offset behavior is affected by the electromagnetic field, arc pressure, and arc stiffness. In the alternating phase, offset of the base arc is largest and offset of the peak arc is smallest. In the synchronous phase, the base and peak arc offsets are somewhere between those in the alternating phase. Dimensional analysis method was used to analyze the factors influencing arc stiffness and in addition, the effects of arc stiffness on arc offset were examined. Increasing the arc stiffness can prevent arc offset, by reducing measurement and experimental errors. Furthermore, the arc stiffness effects were found to be more prominent during the strong pulse compared with the weak pulse, and the arc offsets were smaller in the strong pulse. In the alternating phase, the base arc promotes the formation of molten metal deposits, resulting in the appearance of more prominent fish scales compared with the synchronous phase.

The time-dependence is forced by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and hence the estuary is referred to as a monsoonal estuary. In this paper, we use a three-dimensional, open source, hydrodynamic, numerical model to reproduce the observed annual salinity field in the Mandovi. We then analyse the model results to define characteristics of residual estuarine circulation in the Mandovi. Our motivation to study this aspect of the Mandovi's dynamics is derived from the following three considerations. First, residual circulation is important to long-term evolution of an estuary; second, we need to understand how this circulation responds to strongly time-dependent runoff forcing experienced by a monsoonal estuary; and third, Mandovi is among the best studied estuaries that come under the influence of ISM, and has observations that can be used to validate the model. Our analysis shows that the residual estuarine circulation in the Mandovi shows four distinct phases during a year: a river like flow that is oriented downstream throughout the estuary; a salt-wedge type circulation, with flow into the estuary near the bottom and out of the estuary near the surface restricted close to the mouth of the estuary; circulation associated with a partially-mixed estuary; and, the circulation associated with a well-mixed estuary. Dimensional analysis of the field of residual circulation helped us to establish the link between strength of residual circulation at a location and magnitude of river runoff and rate of mixing at the location. We then derive an analytical expression that approximates exchange velocity (bottom velocity minus near freshwater velocity at a location) as a function of freshwater velocity and rate of mixing.","2016-05-05","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:33:05","","79-92","","","173","","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Estuaries; India; Mandovi; Numerical models; Residual circulation; Salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The heat transfer mechanisms are analysed from the perspective of pyrolysis, thermophysical properties, wall shear stress, and thickness of the boundary layer. The results demonstrate that the heat transfer coefficient increases with mass flow rate. The heat transfer coefficient decreases with increasing heat flux at the inlet section of the heating tube; however, the trend is reversed after a certain distance. The heat transfer coefficient decreases with the increase in the equivalent diameter. The thinning of the boundary layer thickness, increase in the wall shear stress, primary pyrolysis reaction, increase in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and decrease in the viscosity enhance the heat transfer.

However, the characterisation of gas-liquid Taylor flow with industrially relevant fluids at elevated pressure and created by capillary injection devices gained little attention so far. This work analyses adiabatic gas-liquid Taylor flow in a square minichannel of 1.0mm hydraulic diameter using water, water-glycerol, or water-ethanol mixtures as liquid phase and hydrogen or nitrogen as gas phase to cover a broad range of material parameters. In the mixing zone located within the flow channel, gas was injected into the co-flowing liquid by so-called capillary injectors with variable inner diameter (0.184, 0.317, 0.490mm). Two different bubble forming mechanisms were identified leading to a complex interaction between physical properties of the fluids, geometrical parameters and the observed gas bubble and liquid slug lengths.

F-actin filaments, cross-linkers, binding proteins that bundle F-actin filaments to form the actin cytoskeleton, and integrins that connect the actin cytoskeleton network to the cell plasma membrane and extracellular matrix are major cytoskeleton constituents. Thus, the cell cytoskeleton is a complex composite that can assume different shapes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based techniques have been used to measure cytoskeleton material properties without much attention to cell shape. A recently developed surface chemical patterning method for long-term single-cell culture was used to seed individual cells on circular patterns. A continuum-based cell model, which uses as input the force–displacement response obtained with a modified AFM setup and relates the membrane–cytoskeleton elastic behavior to the cell geometry, while treating all other subcellular components suspended in the cytoplasmic liquid (gel) as an incompressible fluid, is presented and validated by experimental results. The developed analytical–experimental methodology establishes a framework for quantifying the membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity of live cells. This capability may have immense implications in cell biology, particularly in studies seeking to establish correlations between membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity and cell disease, mortality, differentiation, and migration, and provide insight into cell infiltration through nonwoven fibrous scaffolds. The present method can be further extended to analyze membrane–cytoskeleton viscoelasticity, examine the role of other subcellular components (e.g., nucleus envelope) in cell elasticity, and elucidate the effects of mechanical stimuli on cell differentiation and motility.

One of the most promising renewable energy sources is solar energy due to low cost and low harmful emissions, and from the 1980s, one of the most beneficial applications of solar energy is the utilization of solar chimney power plants (SCPP). A SCPP is a simple and reliable system that consists of three main components; a solar collector, a chimney (tower) and a turbine to utilize electrical energy. Recently, by the advancement in computer technology, the use of CFD methodology for studying SCPP has become an extensive, robust and powerful technique. In light of the above, in this study, numerical simulations of a SCPP through three-dimensional axisymmetric modeling is performed. A numerical model is created using CFD software, and the results are verified with an experimental study from the literature. After ensuring good agreement with the experiments, chimney’s and collector’s geometric parameters effects and different configurations effects on SCPP performance, simultaneously and additively is investigated. The study introduces an insight to the performance enhancement methods and finding the best configuration of a SCPP model, which will be the basis of a detailed prototyping process. Based on the numerical results, the best configuration of the SCPP has been found as the diverging chimney which enhances the generated power. The results of the study showed that the chimney height and collector radius increase has a positive effect on the power output and efficiency of the system, but when construction and material costs are also considered, each has an optimal value. The maximum impact on the performance is found to be by the chimney tower radius and the collector height and inclination are found to have optimum values considering performance. According to the obtained results, the best performance for the SCPP was obtained with 3.5 m chimney height, 30 cm tower diameter, 400 cm of collector diameter with 6 cm height and zero inclination angle. By the correct selection of the dominant performance parameter which can be done by correctly interpreting the results of this study, “the best” design of a SCPP real scale prototype considering maximum power requirement can be done.","2020-12-10","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:34:29","","122908","","","276","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clean energy generation; Computational fluid dynamics; Geometrical configuration; Solar chimney power plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Laboratory-scale tests display grid-independence problems due to bubble diameter being larger than voxel size, thereby breaking the pointwise Euler-Lagrange assumption of negligible particle size. To tackle this problem and thereby have grid-independent results, a novel data-scaling approach to pointwise Euler-Lagrange grid independence evaluation, based on an application of the Buckingham π theorem, is proposed. Evaluation of laboratory-scale flow patterns and comparison to experimental data show only marginal differences in between the models, and between numerical modelling and experimental data. Pilot-scale simulations show that all the models produce grid-independent, coherent data if the Euler-Lagrange assumption of negligible (or at least, small) particle size is recovered. In both cases, a second-order convergence was achieved.

Compared to traditional surrogate models (polynomial response surfaces, kriging and radial basis functions), it has the advantage of giving light, compact forms with good predictive accuracy over a wide range of the design variables (several orders of magnitude). The general regression process is first explained and illustrated with a study of the Marangoni effect.

This undesirable vapor transfer requires the use of more energy input to compensate for the evaporation heat requirement as well as for subsequent gas purification in the downstream unit. In this paper, both experimental and modeling studies are performed to examine the dynamics of bubble flows and kinetics of water vapor transfer, particularly related to processes of hydrogen production. Experimental data are obtained using an advanced laser-based shadow imaging system and on-line vapor monitoring system. The bubble dynamics and water vapor transfer kinetics are modeled with non-dimensional parameters involving the bubble diameter, velocity and trajectories so that the water vapor transfer rate can be quantified under different operating conditions for various hydrogen production methods. Also, a predictive model is developed to simulate the physical processes of bubble transport in a vertical liquid column, as it occurs in water splitting processes such as oxygen generation in the thermochemical copper–chlorine cycle, as well as hydrogen generation in electrolytic and photocatalytic processes.","2015-03-22","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:20:07","","4047-4055","","11","40","","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bubble dynamics; Hydrogen production; Mass transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BLEVE blast wave mechanism has been widely studied by several authors who proposed simplified approaches based on simple physical models or empirical correlations, but only few approaches including analytical solutions have been undertaken. Moreover, the simplified and empirical approaches are not very satisfactory because they overestimate overpressure measures. In this paper (Part I), an analytical model based on Sedov-Taylor blast wave solution and self-similar theory, which is of great interest in various fields of physics, is proposed for estimating BLEVE overpressure effects. The parameters characterizing the blast wave evolution (overpressure, radius and velocity) are established by applying the Vashy-Buckingham theorem (Pi theorem). To demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to deliver reliable predictions, a validation with large and medium-scale BLEVE experiments issued from the literature is carried out. Furthermore, a comparison with the TNT equivalent model and other models (empirical and simplified physical) is performed. The results of these comparisons are very encouraging and show good agreement in terms of precision.

The etching process is explicitly introduced via step-by-step eigenvalue buckling analysis. Although Model w/oE predicts a constant value of the critical wavelength of wiggling regardless of the change in ridge width, Model w/E predicts a shorter wavelength depending on the decrease in ridge width and the increase in intrinsic compressive stress in the mask layer. In postbuckling analysis, Model w/oE predicts a monotonic increase in the wiggling amplitude with the constant wavelength, whereas Model w/E predicts saturation of the wiggling amplitude owing to the decreasing wavelength. In the explicit modeling of etching process, the wiggling behavior shows completely opposite tendencies.

A pilot-scale plate heat exchanger in countercurrent configuration, supplied with a holder, was used in order to mimic industrial process conditions. The denaturation level and aggregates size of the heat treated β-lg concentrate at the exchanger and holder outlets, along with the fouling mass in the plate heat exchanger were simultaneously determined. The results indicated that β-lg denaturation, aggregation, and fouling reactions were mainly governed by the temperature profile in the investigated range of operating conditions, even though a small influence of residence time and heating rate was highlighted in the less denaturing conditions. A dimensional analysis was performed to identify the key dimensionless numbers governing β-lg denaturation, aggregation, and fouling mechanisms in the heat treatment of a β-lg concentrate. This allowed to emphasise the major influence of the Arrhenius exponential factor of β-lg unfolding reaction, both related to temperature and β-lg reactivity. The first Damköhler and Reynolds numbers, related to residence time and hydrodynamic conditions in the heat exchanger, as well as the heat exchange process parameters, linked to the heat effectiveness and the bulk-wall temperature differences, had also a small impact on β-lg chemical behaviour. Moreover, empirical relationships based only on the Arrhenius exponential factor of β-lg unfolding reaction permitted to describe the main trends observed in denaturation levels, aggregate sizes, and fouling masses, which underlined the predominant role of temperature and β-lg reactivity in the investigated operating conditions.

The simplicity of the model combined with the possibility of the application of theory allows for a nested, and so manageable, procedure of optimization. We find that for any geometry, i.e., a combination of e.g. the breadth-to-length and breadth-to-draught aspect ratios of the box, the optimum is characterized by resonance at least in one of the two degrees of freedom, heave or pitch. Furthermore, optimal geometries turn out to be extremal: either long attenuator-type or wide terminator-type devices perform the best. We find also that optimal wavelengths, which are comparable to the device length in case of attenuators, emerge either due to the progressively increasing buoyancy restoring force characteristic, or due to the finite bandwidth of irregular waves. In particular, diffraction forces are more significant under optimal conditions for performance in irregular seas in comparison with conditions necessary for the most intensive displacement response of the free-floating box barge exposed to regular waves.","2015-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:15:55","","551-565","","","81","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ANSYS AQWA; Box barge; Dimensional analysis; Optimization; Radiation-diffraction analysis; Wave energy converter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the possibility of breaking the requirement for geometric similarity by introducing the law of finite similitude for anisotropic scaling, which applies to continuum mechanics on anisotropically-scaled spaces. The law confirms that similarity solutions on skewed spaces always exist separately for quasistatic deformational and thermal-continuum problems. Thermomechanical and continuum dynamic problems however are shown to suffer from the inclusion of a (non-physical) non-orthogonal metric arising from the skewed coordinate system associated with anisotropic-space scaling. Even in this case however, an important subclass of problems is shown to be physically realisable involving a dominant component of velocity (displacement), where geometric similarity can again be broken yet retain good accuracy. The ability to skew artefacts yet achieve similitude is recognised to be a particularly important outcome as it allows for example one experimental model to be used to predict the behaviour of multiple skewed models. To showcase and highlight the significance of the new concept various scaled numerical models with anisotropic scaling with different geometrical scaling ratios in different directions is considered.

In this new study, a comprehensive comparison analysis between numerical simulation data and experimental measurements obtained for HFC-407C and HFC-410A refrigerants (No = 241) to extend the applicability of the same mathematical model was carried out. Using a widespread statistical analysis, based on weighted linear regressions with an outlier detection/rejection module at 95% of confidence level, the prediction performance of the mathematical model was again assessed. Linear regressions between predicted mass flow rate data and experimental measurements were computed, and used them as a statistical comparison criterion. A statistical comparison between predicted simulation results and mass flow rate experimental data are reported. Average deviation errors of ±11.1% (for the refrigerant HFC-407C) and ±7.3% (for refrigerant HFC-410A) were found between numerical model and experimental data.

Symmetrical and asymmetrical T-micromixers are used to assess the mixing quality improvement, when pulsed signals are imposed to the inlet flows. The used chips are manufactured using polydimethylsiloxane and soft lithography techniques. The flow images are acquired with a high frequency/resolution camera coupled to a microscope, and then are digitally processed. For both symmetrical and asymmetrical geometries, the mixture quality is characterized for non-pulsed flows at different Reynolds numbers, evidencing its fundamental influence on the mixing performance. For pulsed flows, the analysis is based on the parameters that characterize the imposed wave. Results show that the application to both inputs of pulses in phase opposition is the most beneficial, with maximum performance increases of 100% and 90.6%, respectively for the symmetrical and the most asymmetrical micromixers. Moreover, the increase of the pulse amplitude yields an increase of the mixing quality (maximum increase of 90.6% for the most asymmetrical micromixer). Additionally, the increase in frequency results in a decrease of the mixing quality. The width reduction of the outlet channel enhances the mixing quality due to the appearance of vortex structures, whereas its length had no particular influence on the results.

Friction stir welding is a highly complex process comprising several highly coupled physical phenomena. The complex geometry of some kinds of joints and their three dimensional nature make it difficult to develop an overall system of governing equations for theoretical analyzing the behavior of the friction stir welded joints. The experiments are often time consuming and costly. To overcome these problems, numerical analysis has frequently been used since the 2000s. This paper reviews the latest developments in the numerical analysis of friction stir welding processes, microstructures of friction stir welded joints and the properties of friction stir welded structures. Some important numerical issues such as materials flow modeling, meshing procedure and failure criteria are discussed. Numerical analysis of friction stir welding will allow many different welding processes to be simulated in order to understand the effects of changes in different system parameters before physical testing, which would be time-consuming or prohibitively expensive in practice. The main methods used in numerical analysis of friction stir welding are discussed and illustrated with brief case studies. In addition, several important key problems and issues remain to be addressed about the numerical analysis of friction stir welding and opportunities for further research are identified.","2014-08-01","2025-07-11 02:54:40","2025-07-11 08:19:34","","1-66","","","65","","Progress in Materials Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Friction stir welding; Mechanical behavior; Microstructure; Numerical analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Towards this objective, the dispersion and attenuation of surface waves propagating through segmented floating viscoelastic covers was investigated experimentally in this study. The covers were made of oil-doped Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material, with different curing agent percentages to vary their rheological properties. For stiffer covers, the measurements showed that the effect of segmentation on wavelength modification was significant, and the dispersion relation agreed generally with the existing theoretical predictions for discrete floating elastic segments despite the presence of the additional viscosity for the material. At the same time, the earlier empirical formula based on the concept of “equivalent rigidity” to represent the segmented elastic cover, did not work well for the conditions investigated. With more flexible covers, however, the effect of segmentation became insignificant for thin cover thickness. Given the present experimental conditions, we confirmed that the effect of scattering was negligible, and the wave attenuation should be attributed to the various dissipative mechanisms. An empirical relation for the attenuation was established based on the experimental results, to quantitatively relate the attenuation coefficient to the incident wave characteristics and cover properties. The relation identifies a significant inverse relationship with the viscosity of cover material, and thus confirms the essential role of viscoelastic representation for the attenuation predictions.","2020-08-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:31:28","","102233","","","101","","Applied Ocean Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Attenuation; PDMS; Segmented floating covers; Viscoelastic; Wave dispersion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Strain energy and work done of the Belleville spring are formulated based on the classical thin shell theory in a conical coordinate system. The von Kármán and Reissner approximations to the nonlinear strain-displacement relations take the geometrical effects of the moderately and very large axial deflection into consideration, respectively. The Ritz method is used to solve for the deformation and force characteristics of isotropic springs and the solutions are compared with the seminal equation of Almen and Laszlo, experiments, and finite element analyses. The present energy model can capture the effect of a geometric parameter that has been missing from the formulation of Almen and Laszo. The comparison shows that the developed method gives very good agreement with the results from the testing and finite-element method, whereas in most cases, owing to their limited assumptions, Almen and Laszlo's equation overpredicts the applied load at a given deflection. This energy model is also applicable for composite Belleville springs with orthotropic material properties.

The aim of this study is to come up with a zero-brine discharge system that eliminates the continuous need for the supply of source and sink in the conventional system. Based on the fact that earth's atmosphere holds a vast amount of water that can be considered as a reliable freshwater resource, especially in coastal areas. A water-from-air system is proposed in this study. The proposed system configuration comprises of two parts, a basic HDH system that uses a liquid desiccant solution instead of saline water and a desiccant-based air dryer. The liquid desiccant leaves the HDH part at a higher concentration due to the extraction of freshwater. It then enters the air dryer where it is diluted by absorbing water vapor from the ambient air. This diluted desiccant is directed to the HDH part to close the desiccant loop. In this study, Lithium chloride is used as the working fluid of the proposed system.

Starting from caissons at low working stresses, in which case the linear elastic theory provides an adequate engineering model for soil, analytical expressions for the elastic stiffness matrix of a flexible skirted foundation are proposed and validated. To account for the nonlinear foundation response, the paper proposes a simplified equivalent linear iterative approach where the effective foundation stiffness is expressed in terms of deformation amplitude. To this end, utilizing results from a 3D finite element parametric study, non-dimensional charts have been produced for caissons ranging from perfectly rigid to flexible with variable embedment ratios. To deal with uncertainty on the conditions at the soil-skirt interface, three idealized interface scenarios – “fully-bonded”, “tensionless”, “frictionless” – are implemented. Reduced values of foundation stiffness are computed for a frictionless contact. On the contrary, the impact of a “tensionless” interface, whilst trivial in elastic problems, is intensified with progressing soil inelasticity resulting in severely reduced stiffnesses and capacities. Moreover, with increasing relative skirt flexibility, the elastic stiffnesses of deep suction caissons tend to recede substantially, but the rate of stiffness degradation is fairly attenuated.","2018-12-15","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:18:35","","445-465","","","170","","Ocean Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Imperfect interfaces; Nonlinear response; Stiffness; Suction caisson","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An empirical acoustic resistance model of a micro-perforated panel absorber in a high sound pressure environment is suggested to this end. The resistance model is especially appropriate for the launcher fairing application, so that the incident pressure to the surface of bare fairings is considered as a main variable. Other design variables, e.g., the minute hole diameter, the perforation ratio and the thickness of the panel, are also considered in the proposed model. The estimated acoustic resistances and corresponding absorption coefficients are verified by comparing them with the measured results for several micro-perforated panel absorbers having a practical range of parameters. The estimated and measured results show good agreement when the perforation ratio is in the range of 1.4% to 5.3%. The effects of design parameters on the absorption coefficient are discussed. It is demonstrated that the micro-perforated panel absorber with a large hole diameter (about 1.0mm), which shows a poor sound absorption at low pressure levels, can be a good sound absorber at high incident pressure levels. A set of design charts is provided and this enables one to readily design a micro-perforated panel absorber for the mitigation of acoustic loads in launcher fairings.","2013-02-04","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:29:15","","521-535","","3","332","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Drift Flux Model, the mean drift velocity of the gas phase is estimate using the drift velocity closure relationship. This study investigates the motion of a single elongated bubble in high viscosity stagnant liquids in order to propose a comprehensive closure relationship for the bubble drift velocity. Different cases were run with inclination angles varying from 0° (horizontal direction) to 90° (vertical upward). OpenFOAM, an open source Computation Fluid Dynamics software, was used to numerically solve the two-phase incompressible flow problem. Drift velocities based on the movement of the bubble tip and the void fraction weighted averaged were compared to clarify the ambiguity in the drift velocity calculation and measurement. For horizontal pipe cases, the deformation of the bubble caused the drift velocity to be higher at the tip of the bubble than the drift velocity inside the bubble. For inclination angles more than 0°, the drift velocity at the tip is the same as inside the bubble. The closure relationship proposed is validated against experimental data in the literature. The results indicate that the closure relationship has a maximum 10% absolute average relative error for the viscosity range of 0.14–1.120 Pa·s, pipe size up to 0.152 m and pipe inclinations from 0° to 90°.

For plate geometries, one solution for intensifying transfer and increasing residence times is to construct two-dimensional meandering channels. Supported by this scientific context, the present work aims at characterising gas–liquid mass transfer in the same square millimetric meandering channel, as in Anxionnaz (2009), this constituted the preliminary step required for performing exothermic gas–liquid reactions. Firstly, the gas–liquid hydrodynamics were characterised for a water/air system. When compared to a straight channel of identical compactness and sectional-area (2×2mm2), the meandering channel induced (i) a delay in the transition from Taylor to annular-slug regimes, (ii) a rise of 10–20% in bubble lengths while conserving almost identical slug lengths, (iii) higher deformations of bubble nose and rear due to centrifugal forces (bends). Secondly, an original method for verifying the relevancy of the plug flow model and accurately determining kla was used (measurements of concentrations in dissolved oxygen along the channel length). For the Taylor flow regime, kla increased coherently when increasing jg, and the meandering geometry had a small influence. On the contrary, this effect was found no more negligible for the slug-annular flow regime. Whatever the channels, the NTUl remained low, thus showing that, even if millimetric channels allowed to intensify kla, a special attention should be paid for generating sufficient residence times. At identical compactness, the meandering channel was found to be the most competitive. Finally, results on gas–liquid interfacial areas and mass transfer coefficients were confronted and discussed with respect to the predictions issued from the model developed by Van Baten and Krishna (2004).","2011-07-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:30:27","","2974-2990","","13","66","","Chemical Engineering Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Flow structure; Gas–liquid flow regime; Heat-exchanger reactor; Mass transfer coefficient; Meandering millimetric channel; Number of Transfer Units","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it tends to over-read the gas flow rate when directly used to measure the wet gas. How to correct this over-reading and obtain an accurate yet simple wet gas correlation is still one of the challenges in the investigation on the V-Cone throttle device. In this paper, the two-phase mass flow coefficient of the V-Cone throttle device was proposed to correct the deviation of the readings produced by the device. The parameters affecting the coefficient were determined and discussed experimentally. Two V-Cone throttle devices with the respective equivalent diameter ratios of 0.65 and 0.75 were investigated under the condition of the wet gas flow. The test fluid was air and tap water. The gas-to-liquid density ratio ranged from 0.002445 to 0.006083, and the gas densiometric Froude number ranged from 0.3 to 2.0. The influencing parameters including the Lockhart–Martinelli parameter, the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the gas densiometric Froude number and the equivalent diameter ratio were studied. Then the correlations of the two-phase mass flow coefficient and the influencing parameters were proposed for the two V-Cone throttle devices and evaluated experimentally. The results show that the relative deviations of the correlations are less than ±5.0% and the average deviations of the correlations are 2.06% and 2.22% for the V-Cone throttle devices with the equivalent diameter ratio of 0.65 and 0.75, respectively.

These radicals can be used in advanced oxidation processes for water purification. The UV-lamps used in the photochemical reactor lead to a relatively high energy and operating cost. Minimization of these costs is possible via a model-based optimization of the reactor geometry. First, a model is built taking into account the reaction kinetics, the reactor geometry and the radiation intensity distribution in the reactor. Afterwards, two different configurations of photochemical reactors are optimized. The first modeled reactor configuration is a single-lamp reactor and consists of a cylindrical UV-lamp that is present inside a quartz sleeve, outside of which the water flows between it and the external reactor wall (annular channel reactor). A rigorous optimization problem is formulated consisting of the calculation of the optimal reactor geometry (length and radius) in such a way that, for a given reactor volume and a given flow rate of the water to be treated, the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. By solving this optimization problem, it has been shown that an optimal reactor length exists. If the absorption coefficient of the water or the reaction rate constant increases, the optimal reactor length increases as well. The second modeled reactor configuration is similar to the first one but now contains multiple lamps positioned symmetrically in a circular pattern (i.e. multi-lamp reactor). The optimization problem consists of the calculation of the optimal lamp position inside the reactor in such a way that the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. The lamp position is given by the radial distance between the centers of the reactor and a lamp. Again a well-posed optimization problem is obtained and an optimal lamp position exists. If the number of lamps or the reaction rate constant increases or the absorption coefficient of the water decreases, the optimal distance between the centers of the reactor and the lamp increases.","2013-06-07","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:16:24","","174-189","","","96","","Chemical Engineering Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Advanced oxidation processes; Chemical reactors; Mathematical modeling; Multi-lamp photochemical reactor; Optimization; Photochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the wide use of caissons in bridge engineering, until a few years ago this foundation typology has been less investigated than piles and shallow foundations in both static and dynamic field. In most of the published studies, the seismic design of bridge piers was carried out without accounting for soil-structure interaction or by means of an uncoupled approach in which the superstructure was solved independently from the soil-caisson subsystem. In this study, coupled systems made of soil, caisson, pier and deck were analyzed in the time domain by a 3D finite element approach, considering rigid and massive caissons embedded in linear viscoelastic soils. In addition to unravelling the contribution of kinematic and inertial interaction to the total response of the caisson-bridge-pier systems, the study focuses on a particular aspect of kinematic interaction, overlooked in practical design and in most of previous studies, represented by the kinematic bending arising in the bridge pier due to the pier-to-deck joint rigidity. For some critical combinations of soil compliance, caisson geometry, pier height and input motion characteristics, the pier-deck constraint could induce kinematic bending moments in the pier as important as the inertial ones. A closed-form equation was finally proposed to predict the maximum kinematic moment in the bridge pier as a function of the key model parameters identified through the parametric study.","2020-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:28:15","","106341","","","139","","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The isothermal suspension flow behaviors of various solid/liquid systems, i.e., crystalline l-alanine/saturated aqueous solution, PVC beads/water, and glass beads/water, with up to 10 wt-% of particles were investigated and successfully operated in horizontal helical coil tubes without blockage. The densimetric Froude number is used to describe the flow behavior in the coiled tubes in which three different regimes were observed, i.e., homogeneous suspension flow, moving sediment flow, and stagnant sediment. Empirical correlations based on the tube diameter, the mean particle size, the particle mass fraction, the fluid flow rate, the pulsation characteristics of the utilized peristaltic pump, and the physical properties of the system were developed for the critical densimetric Froude number to define the transition between these regimes. Based on this, the particle residence time distributions (RTDS) in the different flow regimes were investigated by step-response experiments from 0 to 1 wt-% of PVC particle tracers in aqueous suspension in a horizontal coiled flow inverter (CFI).

Using similarity theory, the similarity criteria between the aeroelastic model and the prototype have been deduced. A triangular arrangement of three phases is considered, and the arrangements of iced eight-bundled conductors with and without the spacers are divided into six cases. In the experiments, laser sensors at different positions along the span of each phase are used to measure the variation of dynamic displacements with wind speed. Furthermore, galloping characteristics, such as the responses, frequencies, vibration modes, amplitudes and distance between two phases, are obtained for different wind speeds and arrangements. The obtained results show that interphase spacers have a certain inhibitory effect on the first symmetric mode and the first anti-symmetric mode galloping, but not all of the arrangements have a positive effect. The regularity of the variation with wind speed of the anti-galloping effect with interphase spacers is summarized. The galloping amplitude curves indicate that the amplitude is likely to be larger when a modal transformation occurs, in contrast to the results obtained without interphase spacers. The motion of the phase C located close to the diffusion section is different from those of the other two phases.

In this paper, numerical simulation was conducted to get insight into the flow and heat transfer characteristics of supercritical LNG on the tube-side of SCV. The SST model with enhanced wall treatment method was utilized to handle the coupled wall-to-LNG heat transfer. The thermal–physical properties of LNG under supercritical pressure were used for this study. After the validation of model and method, the effects of mass flux, outer wall temperature and inlet pressure on the heat transfer behaviors were discussed in detail. Then the non-uniformity heat transfer mechanism of supercritical LNG and effect of natural convection due to buoyancy change in the tube was discussed based on the numerical results. Moreover, different flow and heat transfer characteristics inside the bend tube sections were also analyzed. The obtained numerical results showed that the local surface heat transfer coefficient attained its peak value when the bulk LNG temperature approached the so-called pseudo-critical temperature. Higher mass flux could eliminate the heat transfer deteriorations due to the increase of turbulent diffusion. An increase of outer wall temperature had a significant influence on diminishing heat transfer ability of LNG. The maximum surface heat transfer coefficient strongly depended on inlet pressure. Bend tube sections could enhance the heat transfer due to secondary flow phenomenon. Furthermore, based on the current simulation results, a new dimensionless, semi-theoretical empirical correlation was developed for supercritical LNG convective heat transfer in a horizontal serpentine tube.

For the numerical simulations, a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package – FLUENT – is used. The rupture distance predictions obtained with both models are compared with experimental data and a reasonable agreement is found. The results of the numerical investigations show that for simulations with negligible viscous, inertial, and gravitational effects, the rupture distance approaches an asymptotic value, which is close to the value predicted by the simplified model. The bridge profiles predicted using the simplified model and the numerical simulation are compared.

Results are shown that support the approach with the modified scaling factors producing a behavior closer to the full-size structure.

Interspersed between the large voids are the densified lumps of sinter which are released on crushing and used as blast furnace feed. The bed transformation process is critical in sintering and is an outcome of the work done on the material by the surface and opposing viscous forces. Less densified, weaker sinter forms when the level of coalescence achieved is low. The process is extremely complex in that it involves a three-phase melt–solids–gas system. In this study, the composition of the sinter bed was simulated using the pressed cylinders of laboratory grade chemicals and the coalescence process was studied by characterising the densification of the cylinders. The alumina, magnesia and basicity of the cylinders were altered (1–4%, 0–2% and 0–3, respectively) to change the properties of the melt and also its solid content. The estimation of solid–melt content, melt composition, viscosity and surface tension was obtained using a thermodynamic model (FactSage) and the reported equations in the literature. Using these results Laplace number of the system was determined as a function of temperature. At the completion of some tests the cooled solidified samples were studied under a microscope. The experimental results showed that the higher sinter density and densification factor were obtained when temperature and sinter mix basicity increased and alumina levels decreased. The effect of magnesia level on densification was less because the porosity of the cylinders altered with magnesium carbonate levels. The trends obtained in sinter densification are consistent with the micro-structural information indicated by optical micrographs. The use of Laplace number to quantify the relative influence of the surface to viscous forces on coalescence was encouraging with a prediction error within ±10%. It was also concluded that the most influential factor determining densification factor was the apparent viscosity of the molten mix as the change in surface force was comparatively small.","2016-04-10","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:27:05","","56-68","","","149","","International Journal of Mineral Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coalescence; Densification; Flow characteristics; Iron ore sintering; Laplace number; Molten mix","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the inevitable annular gap between plunger and tube wall, the liquid above the plunger may leak downward during lifting process. How to model and reduce the liquid leakage flow rate is still challenging to optimize the plunger lift method. In this paper, the geometric and operating parameters affecting the liquid leakage in plunger lifting process were determined and discussed. Seven different diameter ratios between plungers and tube of 0.90–0.98 were investigated experimentally, and the optimal diameter ratio (0.96) was obtained. Based on the force balance over plunger and liquid column, a physical model for the liquid leakage during plunger lifting process was proposed. Combining the experimental data of pressure loss in tube, a dimensionless correlation of liquid leakage flow rate for the optimal diameter ratio (0.96) was developed. The results showed that the relative deviation of the correlation is less than ±10.0%. The influencing parameters including the Euler number of liquid, the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the gas and liquid Froude number, the liquid Reynolds number, and the ratio of lifting distance and loading liquid height were studied. The decrease of the initial differential pressure of liquid column and the increase of the gas production mass flow rate make positive contributions to reduce the liquid leakage flow rate during lifting process.","2018-01-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:35:36","","32-40","","","49","","Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gas wells; Liquid leakage flow rate; Liquid loading; Plunger lift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An acoustic resonator is designed as a cavity split in two equal sub-cavities by the membrane of a loudspeaker. Each sub-cavity is connected to the quiescent ambient by a cylindrical nozzle (a pipe) thus two circular synthetic jets in phase opposition are obtained. The influence of jets interaction has been evaluated by varying the jet-axes-distance (1.1, 3 and 5 nozzle diameters) at a fixed operating condition (Reynolds number equal to 6700 and Strouhal number equal to 0.046); the jets pulsating frequency is kept equal to the sub-cavities resonance frequency and the results are compared with those of the single circular synthetic jet in the same conditions. The flow is characterized with PIV phase averaged measurements. Results for the single synthetic jet are in good agreement with the ones present in the literature and a potential core region is defined for the phase averaged flow field of synthetic jets. Twin circular synthetic jets at jet-axes-distance equal to 3 and 5 diameters show the same behavior with respect to the single circular synthetic jet. Differently, strong interaction effects are seen at jet-axes-distance equal to 1.1 diameters: in particular a double vortex ring structure is visualized. This causes a different velocity distribution in the jet core, higher axial velocities and a lower jet width.","2013-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:19:15","","41-52","","","44","","International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Jet flows; Phase locked measurements; PIV; Synthetic jets; Vortex ring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, statistically rigorous models of propped fracture conductivity are developed using a database of fracture conductivity experiments reported in technical literature over the last 40 years. The database contains about 2700 data points. Propped fracture conductivity is the dependent variable and proppant type, mesh size, proppant concentration, formation hardness, closure stress, formation temperature, and polymer concentration are the independent variables. The full, original database was pared down to various subsets, each having complete information in relation to some subset of the independent variables. The number of independent variables included in each of the resulting databases varied from three to six. Seventy percent of the data was used to develop the models while thirty percent of the data was used to validate them. Fixed effect models were selected using all subsets regression analysis in three, four, and five experimental factors for each of two types of proppant. The five factor model appeared to be the most useful model for both proppant types from a predictive point of view. Five-factor model predictions also compared favorably with an existing propped fracture conductivity model and different case histories published in literature. This project provides engineers with access to a propped fracture conductivity database based on experiments reported over the past 40 years in technical literature. The models developed based on this database can be used to generate predictions of propped fracture conductivity for a variety of proppant characteristics and formation conditions. Also, the models presented here are based on data from experimental investigations in different laboratories, potentially reducing biases that may be present in single laboratory investigations.","2019-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:29:57","","106280","","","182","","Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fracture conductivity; Regression modeling; Statistical analysis of pooled data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim is to obtain the drying curves and calculate the effective diffusivity to predict drying kinetics and thermodynamic characteristics of tomatoes drying. The tomato samples were cut in two different shapes namely flat slices and wedges. In the case of flat slices, there were four different thicknesses, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 cm. For the wedged slices, the tomatoes was slit into 2, 4, 8 and 16 equal sections. The moisture content of the tomatoes varied between 92.5 and 93.6%. The tomatoes were weighed regularly until moisture content fell between 18 and 25%. The Fick’s diffusion equation was used to calculate the effective diffusivity from the experimental data by fitting a linear dependency. A new proposed approach from the Arrhenius equation and a literature model were used to determine thermodynamic parameters. The drying operation lasted from 5 h to 21.25 h for flat slices and 8.5 h to 28.25 h for the wedges. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the new proposed approach are compared with the literature model. Evidently, the Gibbs free energy values indicate that tomato solar drying is a spontaneous natural process.","2019-11-15","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:17:28","","164-174","","","193","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Effective diffusivity; Mixed dryer; Thermodynamic parameters; Tomatoes drying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present paper, hydraulic stability of a multi-layer berm breakwater (MLBB) has been studied through varying the parameter of eroded area. To this end, a 2-D experimental model has been carried out in the wave flume of Tarbiat Modares University using irregular waves with a JONSWAP spectrum. A total of 150 tests have been performed to cover a wide range of sea state conditions and geometrical parameters such as wave height, wave period, water depth, berm width, berm elevation, stone class I height, front slope and nominal diameter of stone class I. In this study, a new dimensionless parameter is introduced to indicate that the wave breaking type plays a fundamental role in stability of MLBBs. Eventually; a new formula is derived to estimate the damage of MLBBs, based on different sea state conditions and various geometrical parameters. Comparisons are made between the estimated damage parameter of MLBBs by the proposed formula and those estimated by existing formulae. The results denote that the present formula not only performs well for MLBBs experimental data, but also indicates a reliable performance for some of Lykke Andersen's (2006) data in statically homogenous berm breakwaters (HBBs) outside the range of given formula. Furthermore, an innovative approach is presented to examine the eroded area based on the berm recession and the intersection point of reshaped and initial profile from SWL, which performs faultlessly rather than the existing one.","2020-03-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:17:38","","103599","","","156","","Coastal Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eroded area; Experimental study; Multi-layer berm breakwaters; Waves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testing of the pilot-scale DuraMelter 1200 at the Vitreous State Laboratory at the Catholic University of America has demonstrated that bubbling increases the melt rate of the batch material, and as a result, melter throughput. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of this pilot-scale waste glass melter are being developed to improve our understanding of the processes that occur within the melter to aid in process optimization and troubleshooting of the WTP melters. Unfortunately, model validation is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining suitable experimental data for operational melters due to the inaccessibility for direct observation and measurements of the high-temperature, opaque fluid through the water-jacketed, refractory-lined steel vessel. This study focuses on assessing the fidelity of the CFD models to accurately predict the bubbling behavior. Because of the paucity of experimental data at the resolution required for CFD validation, a code comparison was used to evaluate two common approaches for simulating flows of two immiscible Newtonian fluids on numerical grids and resolving multiphase interfaces. Here, the volume of fluid and level set methods are used to resolve the dynamically evolving interfaces between the molten glass and the air bubbles. To aid in the validation of the results of these codes, a comparison of the bubble behavior, growth, and frequency of bubble generation are presented and a grid convergence study is performed for the two approaches. The predictions from the two codes are within 6% for the average bubble radius of curvature within the bubble channels, within 2% for average terminal rise velocity of the bubbles, and within 4% for the area mean of the local maxima at the free surface. These parameters are of interest since they affect the convection within the melter and at the interface between the glass and batch layer. Ultimately, the results of this work can assist in confirming the predictive ability of waste glass melter models and provide a better understanding of the flow patterns within the WTP melters.","2018-03-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:18:45","","380-392","","","113","","Annals of Nuclear Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bubbling; Computational fluid dynamics; Interface capturing methods; Two-phase flow modeling; Waste glass melter model; Waste vitrification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mean energy dissipation rate of the tank was 1.14m2/s3 and the diameter of the observed mother drops that breakup were mainly in the range of 1–4mm. Multiple breakup events were the most frequent outcome in the experiments. It was observed that the number of daughter drops produced in a breakup was dependent on the mother drop size. The breakup time increased with the mother drop size and was in the approximate range of 10–100ms. A large uncertainty in the measurements is associated with the determination of the final breakup time, particularly in the cases of high order breakup events.

The fluid velocities in the free stream region, which is a clear (from foam) region on the top of foam block, are measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and hot-wire anemometry. The metal foam data are compared to those of solid blocks with the same size. For low blockage ratios, i.e. thin foam layers, the pressure drop caused by a solid block is higher than that of the foam when tested under identical conditions. Interestingly, nonetheless, beyond a threshold blockage ratio value, the pressure drop induced by the metal foam block exceeds that of the solid block of the same height tested at the same air flow rate. This behaviour is best described as the interplay between resistance caused by blockage versus that of the wake forms downstream and over the objects and additional frictional effects within the porous region and on the interface. Furthermore, a correlation, with ±16% deviation, is developed to predict the flow resistance caused by the solid and foam blocks across the partially filled channel.","2018-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:31:03","","117-128","","","99","","Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Laser Doppler Anemometry; Partially filled channel; Porous media; Pressure drop; Velocity profile; Wake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method of meta-modeling uses scaling laws to extract compact forms of design models from local numerical simulations (FEM). Compared to traditional metamodels (polynomial response surfaces, kriging, radial basis function) the scaling-law-based metamodels have the advantage of a light, compact form and good predictive accuracy over a wide range of the design variables (several orders of magnitude). The general regression process is first explained and then illustrated on different examples: a purely numerical test function, a limited angle electromagnetic actuator and a flexible mechanical hinge.","2014-10-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:16:01","","775-787","","7","24","","Mechatronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Buckingham theorem; Components sizing; Metamodels; Preliminary/conceptual design; Scaling laws; Surrogate modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Turgo turbine, a hydroelectric impulse turbine generally suited for medium to high head applications, has gained renewed attention in research due to its potential applicability to such sites. Nevertheless, published literature about the Turgo turbine is limited and indicates that current theory and experimental knowledge do not adequately explain the effects of certain design parameters, such as nozzle diameter, jet inlet angle, number of blades, and blade speed on the turbine's efficiency. In this study, these parameters are used in a three-level (34) central composite response surface experiment. A low-cost Turgo turbine is built and tested from readily available materials and a second order regression model is developed to predict its efficiency as a function of each parameter above and their interactions. The effects of blade orientation angle and jet impact location on efficiency are also investigated and experimentally found to be of relatively little significance to the turbine. The purpose of this study is to establish empirical design guidelines that enable small hydroelectric manufacturers and individuals to design low-cost efficient Turgo Turbines that can be optimized to a specific pico-hydro site. The results are also expressed in dimensionless parameters to allow for potential scaling to larger systems and manufacturers.","2016-01-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:17:58","","406-418","","","85","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Central composite design; Hydroelectricity; Optimization; Pico-hydro; Response surface methodology; Turgo turbine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By exploring statistically representative sets of random inclusions using linear elastic fracture mechanics expressions, trends of the particle arrangement effect on the stress intensity factor are observed. We find that ordered, random, and clumped inclusion arrangements show an increasing effect on toughness, in that order. These results are verified using finite element analysis. To quantify the observed trend in material behavior with the spatial order of inclusions we consider two metrics of order: the bond-orientational order parameter, Q, and the translational order parameter, T. Finite element models of particle composites with increasing degrees of order reveal that the increasing effect on toughness can be captured and that T is more closely correlated to the effect on the stress intensity factor. We also find that the correlation between the stress intensity factor and particle arrangement is sensitive to the nearest-neighbor distance in Q, revealing that a quantifier approaching a global measure of order is more representative depending on the inclusion volume fraction. The results of this work can improve our understanding of how the stress intensity factor in particle composites explicitly varies with inclusion arrangement. It also provides key insights to develop formulations to engineer random composite microstructures for improved material fracture integrity and to identify issues in quality control of manufacturing methods involving particle distribution.","2018-10-15","2025-07-11 02:56:03","2025-07-11 08:15:22","","33-46","","","202","","Engineering Fracture Mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Composites; Stress intensity factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
