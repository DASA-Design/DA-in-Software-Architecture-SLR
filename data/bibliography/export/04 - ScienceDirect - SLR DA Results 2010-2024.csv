From the given variables, it will be utilised to evaluate the set of dimensionless parameters. It indicates that the validity of the physical law is independent of the specific unit system, and it can be expressed as an identity incorporating only dimensionless variables associated with the law. A python-based function has been developed and reported in this manuscript, which can be utilised to evaluate Pi terms (commonly called π terms) for any fluid flow problem. Smaller moderation in the written function can make it capable of solving any fundamental dimensions. Different fluid mechanics problems are utilised to test and validate the reported function, five of which are presented in this manuscript along with code. Obtained results are in good agreement with the theoretically obtained results.","2022-11-01","2023-07-18 01:32:59","2025-07-11 08:17:34","2023-07-18 01:32:59","103232","","","173","","Advances in Engineering Software","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\9573QL57\Dumka et al. - 2022 - Implementation of Buckingham's Pi theorem using Py.pdf; C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\LS2RYYRJ\S0965997822001363.html","","Buckingham's Pi theorem; Dimensional analysis; Fluid mechanics; Physical similarity analysis; Python programming","BuPi; nrv; RV,rv; SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cutting removal is, however, affected by different parameters including fluid flow rate, drill pipe rotation, cutting size and inclination which have to be considered simultaneously. In the current report, Liquid-Solid model is implemented to solve the governing equations in the Eulerian CFD framework. Results are compared with experimental data and successful validation with experimental data is achieved. On the basis of design of experiment algorithm, further simulations have been carried out to investigate the effect of the as mentioned key parameters on cutting transport behavior. Results show that hole inclinations between 45 and 60° are the most difficult angles in hole cleaning process. Moreover, increase in values of flow rate and drill pipe rotation will effectively improve the drag effects leading to superior cutting removal. Besides, it has been proven that cutting size affects cutting transport less than the other parameters. For industrial applications, an empirical correlation is developed for estimating cutting concentration. Buckingham-π theorem along with multi-variable regression technique is applied to establish the correlation.","2016-08-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:15:27","","670-679","","","34","","Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computational fluid dynamic; Cutting transport; Hole cleaning; Hole inclination; Pipe rotation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to investigate the seismic performance of the CPR1000 prestressed concrete containment vessel (PCCV) structure under design and beyond-design basis earthquake, a 1/20 scale concrete containment vessel (CCV) model was designed and constructed on the shaking table based on the similitude requirements from the Buckingham's π-Theorem. The horizontal and vertical earthquake waves generated from RG1.60 spectrum were selected as the input earthquake waves in the shaking table model test, and the earthquake waves with peak ground acceleration (PGA) 0.2g, 0.3g, 0.4g, 0.5g, 0.7g, 0.9g and 1.2g respectively were loaded step by step until the macroscopic failure occurred in the model containment vessel. The dynamic responses of the model CCV were obtained from the acceleration sensors and resistance strain gages. The model test results showed that the maximum acceleration magnification factor of the model CCV was 1.974 with PGA of 0.2g, which indicated that the CCV had a good seismic-resistant behavior under 0.2g earthquake. Until the second last test case with the horizontal peak earthquake motion of 0.9g (corresponding to 0.9g for the prototype structure), the fundamental frequency of the model CCV only decreased slightly and the maximum tensile strains at all monitoring points were much smaller than the ultimate tensile strain. It meant that the model CCV as a whole was within the elastic range. In the last case (1.2g), the model fundamental frequency decreased steeply. At the same time, the maximum tensile strains at the heel of the cylinder wall far exceeded the ultimate tensile strain and a circle of cracks occurred at the cylinder wall heel. It meant rupture failure had occurred and the cylinder wall heel of the CCV was the weak region. It agreed well with the numerical analysis results and the visual inspection and camera record at the test site. Although a circle of concrete cracks appeared around the cylinder wall foot, the model CCV still remained integral as a whole and neither cracking parts dislocation nor collapse occurred. Because the test model was a plain concrete structure and the model test results should be conservative estimation, it can be concluded that the prototype PCCV for CPR1000 nuclear power plant had sufficient seismic safety margin.","2016-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:30:13","","186-204","","","93","","Progress in Nuclear Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Containment vessel; Nuclear power plant; Seismic performance; Shaking table test; Similarity law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is one nomogram for instantaneous releases, and another for continuous releases. The B&M nomograms were applied to the three Jack Rabbit II (JR II) chlorine release trials being used for the multi-model comparison described in other papers in this special issue. The intent was to use the B&M model as a baseline against which other, more sophisticated models, could be compared. In any model applied to the JR II trials, it is important to properly initialize the cloud characteristics (geometry, density, etc.). The B&M handbook has a simple basic thermodynamics method to calculate the initial size and density of a cloud released as a two-phase pure mixture. It is shown that the B&M nomograms’ predictions of arc maximum concentration (arc max C) for JR II trials 1, 6, and 7 have skill about in the middle of the group of 17 models that are being compared. The B&M predictions are relatively unbiased for Trials 6 and 7 (which has the largest arc max C), but overpredict by a factor of 2 or 3 for Trial 1.

The outflow temperature was the result of the interaction among temperature field, flow field and artificial regulation. To characterize them, three influencing factors (i.e., temperature distribution, outflow rate and submerged depth) were chosen. Experiments were conducted to investigate the response of outflow temperature to influencing factors in a nonlinearly stratified fluid with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Results showed that the withdrawal layer was formed near the level of floating intake inhibited by the density gradient, and its thickness was proportional to stratification intensity. The withdrawal layer ascended with the decrease in submerged depth, and the thickness also changed due to the variation in density gradient. Although the outflow temperature increased, the variation amplitude depended on the temperature gradient between the two submerged depths. However, enlarging the outflow rate within a certain range had relatively small influence on the withdrawal layer thickness and the outflow temperature. Considering the experimental results, a formula was developed for predicting the outflow temperature based on dimensional analysis and energy conservation.","2019-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:31:23","","109893","","","109","","Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Floating intake; Nonlinearly stratified reservoir; Outflow temperature; PIV; Selective withdrawal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A subset of these collectors is collectors that are integrated into building envelope. The so-called “building-integrated” PV/T collectors have seen a dramatic rise in popularity recently. This recent popularity has necessitated systematic design optimization. To benefit design optimization, a review of computer models of these collectors was performed. This review was performed by objectively assessing international findings on roof-integrated and curtain-wall integrated PV/T collectors. The scope of this review was thermal collection efficiency. The significance of this review was to identify the weakest link in computer models that should one day lead to more accurate computer models. This weak link is the internal heat transfer rate. To overcome this weakness, a model calibration method was proposed that is based on case-by-case parameter identification. In addition, a detailed dimensional analysis was performed that allowed a new Π group to be introduced to Nusselt (Nu) number correlations of developing, turbulent parallel-plate flow. This Π group is the Stanton number as applied to the inter-channel radiative heat transfer coefficient (Str). Commonly implemented Nu number correlations do not account for this heat transfer rate. They only account for collector geometry, collector air flow inertia and collector air viscosity.","2016-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:28:29","","102-117","","","63","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Curtainwall; Daylighting; Dimensional analysis; Nusselt number correlations; Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector; Solar-optical properties; Thermal collection efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, such data are lacking for highly curved helixes, probably due to the difficulty to manufacture these geometries through traditional manufacturing techniques. In this paper, CFD simulations are carried out for determining the laminar flow friction factor in helical pipes, particularly highly curved ones. For an experimental validation of the numerical results, a highly curved helix was built by 3D-printing. Existing correlations are shown to fail for the accurate prediction of the friction factor in highly curved helixes. A new correlation is thus proposed.

A large set of experimental data, obtained in SCW flowing upwards in a 4-m long vertical bare tube with a 10-mm Internal Diameter (ID), was analyzed. The data were collected at pressures of about 24 MPa, inlet temperatures from 320 to 350 °C, values of mass flux ranging from 200 to 1500 kg/m2·s and heat fluxes up to 1250 kW/m2, for several combinations of wall and bulk-fluid temperatures that were below, at, or above the pseudocritical temperature. A dimensional analysis was conducted, using the Buckingham Π-theorem, to derive a general form of the empirical SCW heat-transfer correlation for the Nusselt number, which was finalized based on the experimental data obtained within the Normal Heat-Transfer (NHT) and Improved Heat-Transfer (IHT) regimes. The derived correlation showed the best fit for the experimental data within a wide range of flow conditions. This correlation has an uncertainty of about ±25% for Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) values and approximately ±15% for calculated wall temperatures. Subsequently, this correlation was used to calculate HTCs in support of preliminary thermalhydraulic calculations for HXs with SCW and SuperHeated Steam (SHS) as the operating fluids. The HXs are to be designed for integration into the No-Reheat or Single Reheat SCW Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) cycles and provide a link to support hydrogen production through the Cu–Cl cycle. Thermal energy will be transferred from the SCWR to an intermediate SHS loop operating at 5 MPa and delivered to the hydrolysis and oxygen-production process steps of the Cu–Cl cycle facility, which operates at temperatures of up to 530 °C. The analyzed HXs are of a double-pipe, counter-flow design. Calculations involved numerical solutions to identify HX outlet flow temperatures, required pipe lengths, number of pipes for each HX unit, mass flow rates and other relevant heat transfer parameters. Various test conditions have been assessed in support of a database to determine feasible configurations for an HX design.","2012-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:27:58","","16542-16556","","21","37","","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Heat transfer correlation; Nuclear-based hydrogen co-generation; SuperCritical water; Thermochemical Copper-Chlorine cycle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pressing environmental and societal problems require an understanding of how processes operate at different scales, and how they can be linked across scales. Soil science as many other disciplines obtain the bulk of their empirical information at fine scales, whereas results of environmental diagnostics, monitoring, and predictions are needed to make important policy decisions at much larger scales. It becomes imperative to relate the information that is available and produced at different scales. The objective of this work is to present an overview of concepts that are currently used to define and relate scales in soil studies. The paper is not intended to be a compendium, but rather should be viewed as material for discussion, reference, and critique. It discusses definitions and terminology, including general approaches of scale problems in environmental studies that are applicable to soils, including hierarchies, measurement metrics, similitude, non-geometric scale metrics, and notions of upscaling and downscaling. Concepts of general scaling methods and theories are dimensional analysis, power law scaling, space and time dependent scaling. A section on spatiotemporal patterns introduces scaling ideas that were used in soil studies such as empirical orthogonal functions, data assimilation, and cumulative distribution function matching. Reviewed scaling methods developed specifically to soil studies include geometric similitude of pore spaces, scaling with Richards equation, scale dependencies of water and solute flux model parameters, scaling based on temporal stability, overland flow and sediment transport as the scaling phenomenon, and the relevance of scaling to pedotransfer functions. An outlook for scaling research in soils is presented that shows the needs of additional research and the feasibility of using scaling to enrich and advance soil research to help face the grand challenges of modern times.","2017-02-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:29:05","","4-30","","","287","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimension analysis; Hierarchy; Measurement metrics; Power law; Similitude; Spatiotemporal data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance of a given film cooling design, and thus the life of the cooled part, is dependent on the scenario parameters that define the environment in which it operates, including Reynolds and Mach numbers, upstream boundary layer and turbulence characteristics, blowing ratio, density ratio, pressure gradient, surface curvature, etc. Of these, one parameter that has received relatively little attention in the open literature is Mach number. This work evaluates the role of Mach number in shaped-hole film cooling performance by comparing results of two large eddy simulations of a plenum-fed 7-7-7 hole cooling a flat plate at freestream Mach numbers of 0.25 and 0.5, with all other relevant scenario parameters fixed. This comparison shows important differences between the two cases. To begin, the performance, as measured by laterally-averaged adiabatic effectiveness, is dramatically different, with the high Mach case performing up to 50% worse. This decrease in performance at high Mach is due to the coolant jet separating from the surface and a large scale oscillation that leads to significant asymmetry in the time-averaged flow, features which are absent in the low Mach case. These changes appear to be caused by changes to the flow in the cooling hole, which is also asymmetric in the high Mach case. This asymmetry leads to entrainment of hot gas into the hole on one side. Further, in the high Mach case, the flow in the hole is mildly supersonic and has sequence of weak shocks, which are, of course, absent in the low Mach scenario.","2019-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:28:53","","498-517","","","140","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when attempting to avoid these risks, food-processing plants frequently tend to clean for too long, at extremely high temperatures, or with too many chemicals, resulting in high cleaning costs and severe environmental impacts. Therefore, the optimization of cleaning processes in the food industry has significant economic and ecological potential. Unfortunately, in-situ assessments of cleaning processes are difficult, and the multitude of different cleaning situations complicates the definition of a comprehensive approach. In this study, two methodological approaches for the comprehensive modeling of cleaning processes are introduced. The resulting models facilitate comparisons of different cleaning processes and they can be scaled up for processes with similar conditions, using cleaning time as a response. A dimensional analysis is performed to obtain general results and to allow transfer of the approaches to other cleaning situations. The models are established according to the statistical rules for the deduction of multiple regression equations for the prediction of the response based on the input parameters. The terms of the model equation are confirmed with a significance analysis. A machine learning approach is also used to create model equations with symbolic regression. Both methods and the obtained model equations are validated. The two applied approaches reveal similar significant terms and models. Significant dimensionless numbers are the Reynolds number, the density number that describes the ratio of the density of the soil to the density of the cleaning agent, and the soil number, which is a new dimensionless number that characterizes the properties of food soils. The methodology of both approaches is transparent; therefore, the resulting equations can be compared and similarities are found. Both methods are deemed applicable for the computational modeling of cleaning processes in food industry.","2020-04-06","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:17:27","","106733","","","135","","Computers & Chemical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cleaning process; Dimensional analysis; Food industry; Machine learning; Statistical analysis; Symbolic regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important parameter in the design of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems is the wetted pattern of soil area in the up and down wetted areas of drippers. Accurate estimation of the up and down wetted areas in surface/subsurface irrigation systems is essential for enhancing the efficiency of irrigation systems and optimal management of water resources in the field. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) and nonlinear regression (NLR) methods were used to develop equations for the estimation of the up and down wetted areas around the dripper installation position. Experiments were carried out in a transparent physical Plexiglas with dimensions of 3m×1.22m×0.5m. In this study, three different soil textures (i.e., light, medium, and heavy) were used. The drippers at four installation depths, including 0, 15, 30, and 45 cm, were evaluated. By considering an irrigation time equal to 6 h, the emitter discharge rates (i.e., 2.4, 4, and 6 L/s) were applied. Nine different variables, including soil hydraulic conductivity, emitter discharge, soil apparent density, irrigation application time, dripper installation depth, and the soil texture (i.e. amount of clay, silt and sand)were applied as inputs for the developed NLR and ANN models for estimating the up and down wetted areas of drippers. The comparison results between the measured and simulated values showed that the ANN and NLR models have appropriate performances and that the statistical error indices are within an acceptable range. The use of these models for design goals can be helpful in choosing the accurate distance between laterals and emitters as well as the suitable depth of emitters to minimize water losses via deep percolation in surface/subsurface drip irrigation. Furthermore, the results of the ANN and NLR models were compared with an experimental model (developed based on dimensional analysis (DA)) and confirmed the superiority of the ANN and NLR to DA models.","2020-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:18","2025-07-11 08:20:17","","105767","","","178","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural networks; Drip irrigation; Nonlinear regression; Simulation; Wetted area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two experiments were performed to measure the dimensional variation of commercially available lay-flat drip irrigation pipes. A model for estimating the corresponding local head loss was developed and validated using dimensional analysis. The model was then implemented in a finite element algorithm to analyse the hydraulic performance of this type of pipes. Finally, a design example was provided. The results revealed that, for a wall thickness of 0.13 and 0.20 mm, the pipe height and width tended to be equal above a relatively low pressure, and the pipe cross-section rapidly inflated from a quasi-rectangular form to circular. For thicker walls, the equivalent diameter (four times the hydraulic radius) increased continuously with increasing pressure head but it hardly reached its nominal diameter (16 mm). The proposed model indicated that the local head loss was affected by the equivalent diameter, emitter geometry, and flow velocity. The model had high accuracy in determining the local head loss. The estimated results were in close agreement with the measured data. According to the numerical simulation, the ratio of local head loss to total loss along a pipe was up to 74.71%. The design results, when using an earlier model, demonstrated a longer maximum lateral length, since the model did not consider further contraction of the flow caused by pipe deformation.

Optimum lateral length data was obtained from 26 different drip irrigation pipes. The model developed accounted for 98.3% of the variation in the optimum lateral lengths. The model was obtained by considering pipes with inside diameters ranging from 12.3 to 14.2 mm, emitter inside diameters ranging from 11.5 to 12.6 mm, emitter lengths ranging from 31.6 to 68.2 mm, emitter spacing ranging between 0.2 and 1.0 m, emitter discharges ranging from 1.75 to 4.30 l h−1, and emitter flow variations from 10 % to 20 %, with gradients extending downhill or uphill <3%. The errors in the optimum lateral lengths increased with 3% downhill gradients for 0.75 and 1.0 m emitter spacing. The prediction model can be used to calculate the optimum lateral lengths without using any software.","2015-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:34:51","","22-35","","","137","","Biosystems Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimensional analysis; Drip irrigation; In-line emitter; Optimum lateral length; Prediction model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three parameters, namely, vortex vorticity, depth of vortex core, and distance between both vortex cores, are used to characterize the counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) formed by droplets. The crossflow Reynolds number, (initial atomized) droplet Reynolds number, and number of droplets injected per unit time are all found to significantly influence the features of droplets CVP.

Electrospun fiber networks on the other side provide a promising environment for enhanced cell adhesion and growth due to their architecture closely mimicking the structure of the extracellular matrix present within tissues of the human body. Here, we explored the stable integration of electrospun fibers onto the surfaces of elastomeric materials to promote cytocompatibility of these composites. Elastomers based on room temperature vulcanizing silicone (RTV), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as well as functionalized PDMS-based materials were chosen as wafer substrates for attachment of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDFhfp) fibers, a well-known antithrombotic polymer. Electrospinning the fibers onto uncured interfaces acted as bonding agents on the wafers, enabling penetration and formation of a stable bond between the fibers surfaces and the elastomers after curing the interface. Dimensional analysis revealed a relationship between peeling force, intrusion depth and the elastic modulus of the wafers. A design parameter Πα was extrapolated to be used as a predictive tool of the peeling force when intrusion depth of PVDFhfp fibers and elastic modulus of the wafers are known. Cultivating fibroblasts on these hybrid membranes showed cell attachment and growth over 7 days regardless of the composition of the substrate, confirming high cytocompatibility for all composite materials.

The fundamental and applied study of such systems is challenging as a result of the large number of thermo-fluid mechanisms governing the underlying physics. This complexity is significantly reduced by transforming the problem of interest into its scale-free form by means of dimensional analysis techniques. However, the theoretical framework of classical dimensional analysis presents the limitations of not providing a unique set of dimensionless groups, and no support for measuring the relative importance between them. In the interest of addressing these shortfalls for multiphysics turbulent flow applications, we present a semi-empirical dimensional analysis approach to efficiently extract important dimensionless groups from data obtained by means of computational (or laboratory) experiments. The methodology presented is then used to characterize important dimensionless groups in irradiated particle-laden turbulence. The study concludes that two dimensionless groups are responsible for most of the variation in the system’s thermal response, with the absorption of radiation by particles, the radiative energy deposition rate and the turbulent flow mixing the most important thermo-fluid mechanisms.

Results show that the strict flow similarity does not hold if the same design is used for different working fluids, because real gas compressibility effects cannot be disregarded for most of the fluids usually adopted in ORC systems.

In this paper we propose a procedure based on Buckingham π-theorem to perform the scale-up of photobioreactors used to cultivate Chlorella Vulgaris fed by CO2 and wastewater rich in glycerol. This theoretical approach is usually overlooked in favor of the synergy of modeling tailored on the process and piloting, but it grants excellent generalizability. An experimental campaign at three levels was designed and carried out to evaluate the characteristic dimensionless numbers individuated by the theoretical formulation. Since scale-up regards both geometrical dimensions and type of reactor, passing from lab-scale stirred tanks (STRs) to pilot scale tubular and airlift, particular attention was devoted to defining characteristic lengths inside the dimensionless numbers. Moreover, since scale-up also regards the operating mode, scaling from discontinuous to semi-continuous to continuous, some interesting dimensionless numbers arise other than Re, Sh, DaII. They are mainly related to the type of biological process and its operating mode and are the ratios O2/CO2 and T/Topt, the ratio between the incident light intensity and the saturation constant, the absorbance, the ratio between the final and the initial concentration c/c0, the ratio between the maximum increase in cell population and its initial concentration, the ratio between the estimated specific kinetic constant and a variable representing the characteristic time of mixing inside the chosen reactor.

In this study, the ranges of air and water flow rates were set at 0.1–1.0l/min and 30.0–80.0l/min, respectively. The microbubbles were captured by a high-speed camera using shadow photographic technique to obtain the bubbles size distribution as well as the average diameter of the bubbles. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient of oxygen was measured using dynamic physical absorption model. The results verified that the size of microbubble depend on air and water flow rates. The increase of the gas flow rate increased the average bubble diameter. On the other hand, the increase of the water flow rate decreased the average bubble diameter. Furthermore, the increase of water flow rate increased the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient.

However, some of those models require knowledge of geometric parameters or are only designated for radial-type pumps. In this article, dimensional analysis is used as an alternative to analyse head and flow rate degradation of different pumps without the need of any major geometric parameters. To accomplish this task, head curves for two multistage, mixed-flow type ESPs are obtained through a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program for a wide range of viscosities and different rotational speeds. The numerical head curves were compared with experimental data under equivalent operating conditions and a good agreement was found. When adequate normalisations are used together with relevant dimensionless numbers, the head values obtained from the different ESPs proved to match quite well along curves of constant specific speeds. Experimental head values from literature for a radial-type centrifugal pump with volute operating with different fluid viscosities were used to extend the present analysis for a different pump geometry. Results from this procedure turned out to match the ESPs data well. A straightforward expression to correlate head and flow rate correction factors due to viscosity follows from the present approach, thus yielding a useful tool that might help in proposing a general method to estimate performance degradation.","2017-07-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:28:46","","442-450","","","156","","Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CFD; ESP; Performance degradation; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Off-design behaviors of each component determine the system off-design performance in the S–CO2 power cycle. Among components, compressor performances have the largest impact on the system off-design analysis since it operates nearest to the critical point of CO2. In the system analysis, the off-design performance of a compressor is usually pre-calculated for the fixed inlet conditions. The performance map is then converted for the off-design performances prediction using corrected mass flow rate and corrected rpm. Similitude models are used for the conversion. Several similitude models have been developed mostly for air conditions previously, but the applicability of these models to S–CO2 still needs to be tested. In this paper, to evaluate the existing models for the S–CO2 conditions, experimentally validated 1D mean-line code is used to generate wide range of S–CO2 compressor data set. As a result of the evaluation, Pham model showed the most accurate enthalpy rise prediction resulting in the best pressure rise prediction, and the efficiency prediction could be modified with density correction to improve the off-design performance prediction.","2020-12-15","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:20:03","","119071","","","213","","Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Off-design performance prediction; Performance map; S–CO compressor; Similitude analysis; Supercritical CO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research of models able to predict the energy consumption from the first design and energy planning phase is conducted to improve building sustainability. Use of traditional forecasting tools for building thermal energy demand tends to encounter difficulties relevant to the amount of data required, implementation of the models, computational costs and inability to generalize the output. Therefore, many studies focused on the research and development of alternative resolution methods, but the choice of the most convenient is not clear and simple. Single comparison of statistical quality indexes does not allow an adequate identification of the most efficient method, as the necessary efforts for implementation of the methods from the initial data collection to the use phase are not considered. In this work, the authors propose to apply, for the first time, the multicriteria assessment to determine the most efficient alternative method, used for forecasting of building thermal energy demand. Three alternative “black-box” methods, previously investigated by the authors, were compared by the multiple criteria Complex Proportional Assessment Method. Such a procedure revealed ranking of the methods in four phases, namely Pre-processing, Implementation, Post-processing and Use, as well as overall assessment and selection of the most efficient method in terms of evaluated criteria. This first application could represent an incentive for future multi-criteria analyses involving a growing number of alternative forecasting methods.","2020-10-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:16:38","","110220","","","224","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural network; Building thermal energy demand; Dimensionless analysis; Forecasting method; Multiple criteria assessment; Multiple linear regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, screening efficiency and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined rotating screen drum for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating screen drum equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates. The shaping effects of the rotating screen drum were evaluated from the measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics (size distribution, water content, compactness, and circularity) on wet soft agglomerates. To describe the screening efficiency parameters of a rotary screen drum, a specific method was developed by using a matrix analysis of the different measured weights of the collected products. The impacts of rotating screen drum parameters (angle of inclination, rotating speed, and product flow rate) on the sieving efficiency and on the shaping effects were investigated. The present results demonstrate high apparent screening efficiency of the rotating screen drum when used with wet agglomerates of durum wheat, ranging between 89 and 96% depending on the process conditions Finally, using dimensional analysis, two correlations were proposed on the circularity and the apparent screening efficiency whatever the operating conditions used (drum speed, angle of inclination and feed rate).","2017-02-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:15:51","","235-246","","","195","","Journal of Food Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agglomeration mechanisms; Circularity; Dimensional analysis; Durum wheat couscous; Rotating screen drum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A correlation is presented for determining the effectiveness of heat and mass transfer in a horizontal-axis, tumble-type clothes dryer drum with axial airflow. The correlation is a function of four measurable quantities: air mass flow rate, cloth mass, air mass in the drum, and the fall time experienced by a cloth falling the full height (i.e. diameter) of the drum. The Buckingham Pi Theorem is applied to the problem in order to derive dimensionless terms upon which the effectiveness depends. Empirical data from several dryers are used to derive an empirical correlation as a function of the dimensionless variables. Three cloth types were investigated, and a separate empirical correlation is proposed for each. Together, the drum effectiveness concept and the correlation presented provide a new, more accurate, computationally efficient, and readily implemented framework for modeling and simulating clothes dryers.

In this paper, the dimensional analysis and the incomplete self-similarity theory were used to deduce a model relating the volume of sediments eroded from the calanchi area to a set of geometric attributes of their tributary areas. The morphometric characteristics of 209 calanchi basins were used to calibrate and validate the model. The predictive skill of the model was assessed by calculating the mean square error and the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient. The model was found to provide a reliable prediction of eroded volume from basins entirely covered by calanchi landforms as well as from basins only partially affected by badland erosion processes. Furthermore, as the residuals between the calculated and the measured volume of the eroded material are normally distributed, the deterministic model may be considered complete, meaning that no other variables are necessary to explain the studied physical process. In other words, the model is able to predict erosion volume in calanchi landforms from a deterministic point of view.","2015-02-15","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:16:08","","292-300","","","231","","Geomorphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Badlands; Dimensional analysis; Self-similarity theory; Sicily; Soil erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a research conducted among machines that consume electricity, pumps come first with 25 %. Accurate estimation of pressure losses is a key point in order to select pump systems. Hot water from the geothermal area is carried by pipeline systems. In this study, extensive experimental study is conducted at Izmir Katip Celebi University Flow Loop using pure water for fluid temperature from 25 °C to 60 °C, for four various relative roughness values, and for Reynolds Number ranges from 6.2 × 104 to 7.8 × 105. This study has mainly two objectives: First is to identify if the absolute pipe roughness values of commercially available pipes vary according to the pipe diameter. The second objective is to investigate fluid temperature effects on frictional pressure losses in rough pipes and to present a new friction factor correlation for using in geothermal pipelines, considering the fluid temperature effects. Experimental study shows that absolute pipe roughness varies substantially for pipe diameters. The proposed friction factor has a good agreement with explicit formulas of Blasius (1913) and Taler (2016) equations for smooth pipes and Colebrook (1939) equation for rough pipes, as well as experimental data at various temperature values. Additionally, frictional pressure losses are accurately estimated using new friction factor equation. Results show that both relative roughness and temperature have a significant influence on the friction factor for turbulent flow through rough pipes. For this reason, pipe roughness should be determined correctly and the effects of fluid temperature on pressure losses should be considered. This may influence frictional head losses per unit length and, consequently, the predicted pumping requirements in geothermal pipelines.","2020-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:31:26","","101901","","","88","","Geothermics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Energy; Friction factor; Geothermal energy; Pressure loss; Rough pipe; Temperature; Turbulent flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relative movements between tool electrode and work material controls the energy penetration rate, and subsequently effects the performance characteristics. Therefore, the effect of process parameters associated with feeding motion and ECD energy are important to investigate simultaneously with respect to the performance characteristics. In the current study, a Buckingham’s dimensional method was used to determine the relation between input process parameters (that includes simultaneous interaction of ECD energy based parameters and feeding motion based parameters) and performance characteristics.

The hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater model is evaluated through wave measurements in a wave flume under irregular waves. The experiments are undertaken with three setups; (i) a wave screen is attached to the front curved wall of the semicircular breakwater and none at the rear wall, (ii) a wave screen is attached at the rear curved wall of the semicircular breakwater and none at the front wall and (iii) wave screens one each is attached to the front and rear walls of the semicircular breakwater. The wave surface elevations are measured at different locations upstream and downstream of the breakwater model and the coefficients of wave transmission, reflection and energy dissipation are determined. Wave climate in the vicinity of the breakwater and the horizontal wave force on the model are also measured and analysed. The results show that the semicircular breakwater with double screens of 25% porosity is the most viable design that offers reasonably good hydraulic performance as this acts as an energy dissipater rather than a wave reflector. Further, empirical models developed using a multi-regression method for estimation of reflection, transmission and energy loss coefficients as well as the normalised wave force coefficients, correlates well with the experimental data.","2013-09-15","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:32:11","","160-176","","","70","","Ocean Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Energy dissipation; Semicircular breakwater; Wave forces; Wave reflection; Wave screen; Wave transmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Notwithstanding, the use of specialized software tools poses many challenges in regards to the retrieval of reliable and detailed information, setting a steep learning curve for engineers and energy managers. To speed up the preliminary assessment phase, it might be more convenient to resort to a simplified model that allows the evaluation of heating energy demand with a good level of accuracy and without excessive computational cost or user expertise. Dimensional analysis is a means of simplifying a physical problem by appealing to dimensional homogeneity to reduce the number of relevant variables. In this work, the authors investigated an alternative approach to assess the thermal energy demand of a high-performance-non-residential building. It was possible to define some dimensionless numbers that synthetically describe the links between the main characteristic parameters of the thermal balance by applying the Buckingham π theorem. After a detailed description of the Buckingham π theorem and of its application concerning the evaluation of the building energy balance, the authors identified nine “ad hoc” dimensionless numbers. The proposed methodology has been validated by the comparison of the heating energy demand calculated by detailed dynamic simulations carried out in TRNSYS according to the standards and laws of building energy requirements in seven different European countries. Applying a set of criteria, it was possible to employ a dimensionless number to determine, immediately and without any calculation or use of steady/dynamic software, the heating energy demand with an reliability >90%.","2017-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:19","2025-07-11 08:16:23","","479-490","","","154","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Buckingham  theorem; Building thermal balance; Dimensionless parameters; Dynamic simulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die fill is important because it limits the productivity of tablet presses and determines key quality attributes of tablets including weight and content uniformity. Die fill occurs due to gravity and suction fill mechanisms. A model linear shoe-die filling system has been instrumented with pressure measurement devices for detailed characterisation of air pressure evolution as the powder mass is delivered in the die. Systematic experiments were carried out using a range of microcrystalline cellulose powders to explore the role of powder properties (such as particle size and bulk density) and operating parameters (such as shoe and die geometry, shoe and suction punch kinematics and powder filling level) on powder delivery. Existing models were found inadequate to describe the mass flow rate of powders under a diversity of gravity and suction filling conditions. The pressure measurements enabled the development of a new die fill model using the Buckingham Π theorem. The model includes separate terms for the contribution of the mass of powder delivered under gravity and suction fill mechanisms. The experimental procedures required to extract the parameters of the model are described. The model is applicable to the handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders where small differences in air pressure have a significant impact on the powder flow process. The practical application of the model for predicting die filling behaviour in a high-speed rotary tablet press is demonstrated by assuming operating conditions of a typical rotary tablet press.

Arc offsets in the synchronous and alternating phases were captured using high-speed photography and corresponding voltage and current waveforms were simultaneously recorded during the welding process. Experimental results show the arc offset behavior is affected by the electromagnetic field, arc pressure, and arc stiffness. In the alternating phase, offset of the base arc is largest and offset of the peak arc is smallest. In the synchronous phase, the base and peak arc offsets are somewhere between those in the alternating phase. Dimensional analysis method was used to analyze the factors influencing arc stiffness and in addition, the effects of arc stiffness on arc offset were examined. Increasing the arc stiffness can prevent arc offset, by reducing measurement and experimental errors. Furthermore, the arc stiffness effects were found to be more prominent during the strong pulse compared with the weak pulse, and the arc offsets were smaller in the strong pulse. In the alternating phase, the base arc promotes the formation of molten metal deposits, resulting in the appearance of more prominent fish scales compared with the synchronous phase.

The time-dependence is forced by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and hence the estuary is referred to as a monsoonal estuary. In this paper, we use a three-dimensional, open source, hydrodynamic, numerical model to reproduce the observed annual salinity field in the Mandovi. We then analyse the model results to define characteristics of residual estuarine circulation in the Mandovi. Our motivation to study this aspect of the Mandovi's dynamics is derived from the following three considerations. First, residual circulation is important to long-term evolution of an estuary; second, we need to understand how this circulation responds to strongly time-dependent runoff forcing experienced by a monsoonal estuary; and third, Mandovi is among the best studied estuaries that come under the influence of ISM, and has observations that can be used to validate the model. Our analysis shows that the residual estuarine circulation in the Mandovi shows four distinct phases during a year: a river like flow that is oriented downstream throughout the estuary; a salt-wedge type circulation, with flow into the estuary near the bottom and out of the estuary near the surface restricted close to the mouth of the estuary; circulation associated with a partially-mixed estuary; and, the circulation associated with a well-mixed estuary. Dimensional analysis of the field of residual circulation helped us to establish the link between strength of residual circulation at a location and magnitude of river runoff and rate of mixing at the location. We then derive an analytical expression that approximates exchange velocity (bottom velocity minus near freshwater velocity at a location) as a function of freshwater velocity and rate of mixing.","2016-05-05","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:33:05","","79-92","","","173","","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Estuaries; India; Mandovi; Numerical models; Residual circulation; Salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The heat transfer mechanisms are analysed from the perspective of pyrolysis, thermophysical properties, wall shear stress, and thickness of the boundary layer.

F-actin filaments, cross-linkers, binding proteins that bundle F-actin filaments to form the actin cytoskeleton, and integrins that connect the actin cytoskeleton network to the cell plasma membrane and extracellular matrix are major cytoskeleton constituents. Thus, the cell cytoskeleton is a complex composite that can assume different shapes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based techniques have been used to measure cytoskeleton material properties without much attention to cell shape. A recently developed surface chemical patterning method for long-term single-cell culture was used to seed individual cells on circular patterns. A continuum-based cell model, which uses as input the force–displacement response obtained with a modified AFM setup and relates the membrane–cytoskeleton elastic behavior to the cell geometry, while treating all other subcellular components suspended in the cytoplasmic liquid (gel) as an incompressible fluid, is presented and validated by experimental results. The developed analytical–experimental methodology establishes a framework for quantifying the membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity of live cells. This capability may have immense implications in cell biology, particularly in studies seeking to establish correlations between membrane–cytoskeleton elasticity and cell disease, mortality, differentiation, and migration, and provide insight into cell infiltration through nonwoven fibrous scaffolds. The present method can be further extended to analyze membrane–cytoskeleton viscoelasticity, examine the role of other subcellular components (e.g., nucleus envelope) in cell elasticity, and elucidate the effects of mechanical stimuli on cell differentiation and motility.

One of the most promising renewable energy sources is solar energy due to low cost and low harmful emissions, and from the 1980s, one of the most beneficial applications of solar energy is the utilization of solar chimney power plants (SCPP). A SCPP is a simple and reliable system that consists of three main components; a solar collector, a chimney (tower) and a turbine to utilize electrical energy. Recently, by the advancement in computer technology, the use of CFD methodology for studying SCPP has become an extensive, robust and powerful technique. In light of the above, in this study, numerical simulations of a SCPP through three-dimensional axisymmetric modeling is performed. A numerical model is created using CFD software, and the results are verified with an experimental study from the literature. After ensuring good agreement with the experiments, chimney’s and collector’s geometric parameters effects and different configurations effects on SCPP performance, simultaneously and additively is investigated. The study introduces an insight to the performance enhancement methods and finding the best configuration of a SCPP model, which will be the basis of a detailed prototyping process. Based on the numerical results, the best configuration of the SCPP has been found as the diverging chimney which enhances the generated power. The results of the study showed that the chimney height and collector radius increase has a positive effect on the power output and efficiency of the system, but when construction and material costs are also considered, each has an optimal value. The maximum impact on the performance is found to be by the chimney tower radius and the collector height and inclination are found to have optimum values considering performance. According to the obtained results, the best performance for the SCPP was obtained with 3.5 m chimney height, 30 cm tower diameter, 400 cm of collector diameter with 6 cm height and zero inclination angle. By the correct selection of the dominant performance parameter which can be done by correctly interpreting the results of this study, “the best” design of a SCPP real scale prototype considering maximum power requirement can be done.","2020-12-10","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:34:29","","122908","","","276","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clean energy generation; Computational fluid dynamics; Geometrical configuration; Solar chimney power plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The set comprises a local model, a “first-neighbour” (viz., back-coupling occurs to the voxel where a particle sits, plus its first neighbours) and a “smoothing-kernel” (forward- and back-coupling occur through a smoothed-kernel averaging procedure). Laboratory-scale tests display grid-independence problems due to bubble diameter being larger than voxel size, thereby breaking the pointwise Euler-Lagrange assumption of negligible particle size. To tackle this problem and thereby have grid-independent results, a novel data-scaling approach to pointwise Euler-Lagrange grid independence evaluation, based on an application of the Buckingham π theorem, is proposed. Evaluation of laboratory-scale flow patterns and comparison to experimental data show only marginal differences in between the models, and between numerical modelling and experimental data. Pilot-scale simulations show that all the models produce grid-independent, coherent data if the Euler-Lagrange assumption of negligible (or at least, small) particle size is recovered. In both cases, a second-order convergence was achieved. A discussion follows on the opportunity of applying the proposed data-scaling approach rather than the smoothing-kernel model.","2020-09-15","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:16:41","","104632","","","209","","Computers & Fluids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anaerobic digestion; Euler-Lagrange; Grid independence; Lattice-Boltzmann; Non-Newtonian; OpenLB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theoretical models have been developed for both regenerator and desiccator and gave good agreement with the experiments. The verified computer model is used to predict the performance of the whole system during the hot summer months in Mumbai, Chittagong, Muscat, Messina and Havana. Taking examples of temperate, sub-tropical, tropical and heat-tolerant tropical crops (lettuce, soya bean, tomato and cucumber respectively) we estimate the extensions in growing seasons enabled by the system. Compared to conventional evaporative cooling, the desiccant system lowers average daily maximum temperatures in the hot season by 5.5–7.5 °C, sufficient to maintain viable growing conditions for lettuce throughout the year. In the case of tomato, cucumber and soya bean the system enables optimal cultivation through most summer months.

This undesirable vapor transfer requires the use of more energy input to compensate for the evaporation heat requirement as well as for subsequent gas purification in the downstream unit. In this paper, both experimental and modeling studies are performed to examine the dynamics of bubble flows and kinetics of water vapor transfer, particularly related to processes of hydrogen production. Experimental data are obtained using an advanced laser-based shadow imaging system and on-line vapor monitoring system. The bubble dynamics and water vapor transfer kinetics are modeled with non-dimensional parameters involving the bubble diameter, velocity and trajectories so that the water vapor transfer rate can be quantified under different operating conditions for various hydrogen production methods. Also, a predictive model is developed to simulate the physical processes of bubble transport in a vertical liquid column, as it occurs in water splitting processes such as oxygen generation in the thermochemical copper–chlorine cycle, as well as hydrogen generation in electrolytic and photocatalytic processes.","2015-03-22","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:20:07","","4047-4055","","11","40","","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bubble dynamics; Hydrogen production; Mass transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BLEVE blast wave mechanism has been widely studied by several authors who proposed simplified approaches based on simple physical models or empirical correlations, but only few approaches including analytical solutions have been undertaken. Moreover, the simplified and empirical approaches are not very satisfactory because they overestimate overpressure measures. In this paper (Part I), an analytical model based on Sedov-Taylor blast wave solution and self-similar theory, which is of great interest in various fields of physics, is proposed for estimating BLEVE overpressure effects. The parameters characterizing the blast wave evolution (overpressure, radius and velocity) are established by applying the Vashy-Buckingham theorem (Pi theorem). To demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to deliver reliable predictions, a validation with large and medium-scale BLEVE experiments issued from the literature is carried out. Furthermore, a comparison with the TNT equivalent model and other models (empirical and simplified physical) is performed. The results of these comparisons are very encouraging and show good agreement in terms of precision.

Although Model w/oE predicts a constant value of the critical wavelength of wiggling regardless of the change in ridge width, Model w/E predicts a shorter wavelength depending on the decrease in ridge width and the increase in intrinsic compressive stress in the mask layer.

A pilot-scale plate heat exchanger in countercurrent configuration, supplied with a holder, was used in order to mimic industrial process conditions. The denaturation level and aggregates size of the heat treated β-lg concentrate at the exchanger and holder outlets, along with the fouling mass in the plate heat exchanger were simultaneously determined. The results indicated that β-lg denaturation, aggregation, and fouling reactions were mainly governed by the temperature profile in the investigated range of operating conditions, even though a small influence of residence time and heating rate was highlighted in the less denaturing conditions. A dimensional analysis was performed to identify the key dimensionless numbers governing β-lg denaturation, aggregation, and fouling mechanisms in the heat treatment of a β-lg concentrate. This allowed to emphasise the major influence of the Arrhenius exponential factor of β-lg unfolding reaction, both related to temperature and β-lg reactivity. The first Damköhler and Reynolds numbers, related to residence time and hydrodynamic conditions in the heat exchanger, as well as the heat exchange process parameters, linked to the heat effectiveness and the bulk-wall temperature differences, had also a small impact on β-lg chemical behaviour. Moreover, empirical relationships based only on the Arrhenius exponential factor of β-lg unfolding reaction permitted to describe the main trends observed in denaturation levels, aggregate sizes, and fouling masses, which underlined the predominant role of temperature and β-lg reactivity in the investigated operating conditions.

Furthermore, optimal geometries turn out to be extremal: either long attenuator-type or wide terminator-type devices perform the best. We find also that optimal wavelengths, which are comparable to the device length in case of attenuators, emerge either due to the progressively increasing buoyancy restoring force characteristic, or due to the finite bandwidth of irregular waves. In particular, diffraction forces are more significant under optimal conditions for performance in irregular seas in comparison with conditions necessary for the most intensive displacement response of the free-floating box barge exposed to regular waves.","2015-09-01","2025-07-11 02:54:20","2025-07-11 08:15:55","","551-565","","","81","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ANSYS AQWA; Box barge; Dimensional analysis; Optimization; Radiation-diffraction analysis; Wave energy converter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the possibility of breaking the requirement for geometric similarity by introducing the law of finite similitude for anisotropic scaling, which applies to continuum mechanics on anisotropically-scaled spaces. The law confirms that similarity solutions on skewed spaces always exist separately for quasistatic deformational and thermal-continuum problems. Thermomechanical and continuum dynamic problems however are shown to suffer from the inclusion of a (non-physical) non-orthogonal metric arising from the skewed coordinate system associated with anisotropic-space scaling. Even in this case however, an important subclass of problems is shown to be physically realisable involving a dominant component of velocity (displacement), where geometric similarity can again be broken yet retain good accuracy. The ability to skew artefacts yet achieve similitude is recognised to be a particularly important outcome as it allows for example one experimental model to be used to predict the behaviour of multiple skewed models. To showcase and highlight the significance of the new concept various scaled numerical models with anisotropic scaling with different geometrical scaling ratios in different directions is considered. The applicability of the theory is tested on a number of case studies providing strong supporting evidence for the validity and applicability of the new theory.","2020-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:40","2025-07-11 08:17:08","","105925","","","187","","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anisotropic scaling; Finite similitude; Scaled experimentation; Scaled models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Symmetrical and asymmetrical T-micromixers are used to assess the mixing quality improvement, when pulsed signals are imposed to the inlet flows. The used chips are manufactured using polydimethylsiloxane and soft lithography techniques. The flow images are acquired with a high frequency/resolution camera coupled to a microscope, and then are digitally processed. For both symmetrical and asymmetrical geometries, the mixture quality is characterized for non-pulsed flows at different Reynolds numbers, evidencing its fundamental influence on the mixing performance. For pulsed flows, the analysis is based on the parameters that characterize the imposed wave. Results show that the application to both inputs of pulses in phase opposition is the most beneficial, with maximum performance increases of 100% and 90.6%, respectively for the symmetrical and the most asymmetrical micromixers. Moreover, the increase of the pulse amplitude yields an increase of the mixing quality (maximum increase of 90.6% for the most asymmetrical micromixer). Additionally, the increase in frequency results in a decrease of the mixing quality. The width reduction of the outlet channel enhances the mixing quality due to the appearance of vortex structures, whereas its length had no particular influence on the results.

Friction stir welding is a highly complex process comprising several highly coupled physical phenomena. The complex geometry of some kinds of joints and their three dimensional nature make it difficult to develop an overall system of governing equations for theoretical analyzing the behavior of the friction stir welded joints. The experiments are often time consuming and costly. To overcome these problems, numerical analysis has frequently been used since the 2000s. This paper reviews the latest developments in the numerical analysis of friction stir welding processes, microstructures of friction stir welded joints and the properties of friction stir welded structures. Some important numerical issues such as materials flow modeling, meshing procedure and failure criteria are discussed. Numerical analysis of friction stir welding will allow many different welding processes to be simulated in order to understand the effects of changes in different system parameters before physical testing, which would be time-consuming or prohibitively expensive in practice. The main methods used in numerical analysis of friction stir welding are discussed and illustrated with brief case studies. In addition, several important key problems and issues remain to be addressed about the numerical analysis of friction stir welding and opportunities for further research are identified.","2014-08-01","2025-07-11 02:54:40","2025-07-11 08:19:34","","1-66","","","65","","Progress in Materials Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Friction stir welding; Mechanical behavior; Microstructure; Numerical analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Towards this objective, the dispersion and attenuation of surface waves propagating through segmented floating viscoelastic covers was investigated experimentally in this study. The covers were made of oil-doped Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material, with different curing agent percentages to vary their rheological properties. For stiffer covers, the measurements showed that the effect of segmentation on wavelength modification was significant, and the dispersion relation agreed generally with the existing theoretical predictions for discrete floating elastic segments despite the presence of the additional viscosity for the material. At the same time, the earlier empirical formula based on the concept of “equivalent rigidity” to represent the segmented elastic cover, did not work well for the conditions investigated. With more flexible covers, however, the effect of segmentation became insignificant for thin cover thickness. Given the present experimental conditions, we confirmed that the effect of scattering was negligible, and the wave attenuation should be attributed to the various dissipative mechanisms. An empirical relation for the attenuation was established based on the experimental results, to quantitatively relate the attenuation coefficient to the incident wave characteristics and cover properties. The relation identifies a significant inverse relationship with the viscosity of cover material, and thus confirms the essential role of viscoelastic representation for the attenuation predictions.","2020-08-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:31:28","","102233","","","101","","Applied Ocean Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Attenuation; PDMS; Segmented floating covers; Viscoelastic; Wave dispersion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The von Kármán and Reissner approximations to the nonlinear strain-displacement relations take the geometrical effects of the moderately and very large axial deflection into consideration, respectively. The Ritz method is used to solve for the deformation and force characteristics of isotropic springs and the solutions are compared with the seminal equation of Almen and Laszlo, experiments, and finite element analyses. The present energy model can capture the effect of a geometric parameter that has been missing from the formulation of Almen and Laszo. The comparison shows that the developed method gives very good agreement with the results from the testing and finite-element method, whereas in most cases, owing to their limited assumptions, Almen and Laszlo's equation overpredicts the applied load at a given deflection.

Starting from caissons at low working stresses, in which case the linear elastic theory provides an adequate engineering model for soil, analytical expressions for the elastic stiffness matrix of a flexible skirted foundation are proposed and validated. To account for the nonlinear foundation response, the paper proposes a simplified equivalent linear iterative approach where the effective foundation stiffness is expressed in terms of deformation amplitude. To this end, utilizing results from a 3D finite element parametric study, non-dimensional charts have been produced for caissons ranging from perfectly rigid to flexible with variable embedment ratios. To deal with uncertainty on the conditions at the soil-skirt interface, three idealized interface scenarios – “fully-bonded”, “tensionless”, “frictionless” – are implemented. Reduced values of foundation stiffness are computed for a frictionless contact. On the contrary, the impact of a “tensionless” interface, whilst trivial in elastic problems, is intensified with progressing soil inelasticity resulting in severely reduced stiffnesses and capacities. Moreover, with increasing relative skirt flexibility, the elastic stiffnesses of deep suction caissons tend to recede substantially, but the rate of stiffness degradation is fairly attenuated.","2018-12-15","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:18:35","","445-465","","","170","","Ocean Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Imperfect interfaces; Nonlinear response; Stiffness; Suction caisson","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An empirical acoustic resistance model of a micro-perforated panel absorber in a high sound pressure environment is suggested to this end. The resistance model is especially appropriate for the launcher fairing application, so that the incident pressure to the surface of bare fairings is considered as a main variable. Other design variables, e.g., the minute hole diameter, the perforation ratio and the thickness of the panel, are also considered in the proposed model. The estimated acoustic resistances and corresponding absorption coefficients are verified by comparing them with the measured results for several micro-perforated panel absorbers having a practical range of parameters. The estimated and measured results show good agreement when the perforation ratio is in the range of 1.4% to 5.3%. The effects of design parameters on the absorption coefficient are discussed. It is demonstrated that the micro-perforated panel absorber with a large hole diameter (about 1.0mm), which shows a poor sound absorption at low pressure levels, can be a good sound absorber at high incident pressure levels. A set of design charts is provided and this enables one to readily design a micro-perforated panel absorber for the mitigation of acoustic loads in launcher fairings.","2013-02-04","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:29:15","","521-535","","3","332","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Drift Flux Model, the mean drift velocity of the gas phase is estimate using the drift velocity closure relationship. This study investigates the motion of a single elongated bubble in high viscosity stagnant liquids in order to propose a comprehensive closure relationship for the bubble drift velocity. Different cases were run with inclination angles varying from 0° (horizontal direction) to 90° (vertical upward). OpenFOAM, an open source Computation Fluid Dynamics software, was used to numerically solve the two-phase incompressible flow problem. Drift velocities based on the movement of the bubble tip and the void fraction weighted averaged were compared to clarify the ambiguity in the drift velocity calculation and measurement. For horizontal pipe cases, the deformation of the bubble caused the drift velocity to be higher at the tip of the bubble than the drift velocity inside the bubble. For inclination angles more than 0°, the drift velocity at the tip is the same as inside the bubble. The closure relationship proposed is validated against experimental data in the literature. The results indicate that the closure relationship has a maximum 10% absolute average relative error for the viscosity range of 0.14–1.120 Pa·s, pipe size up to 0.152 m and pipe inclinations from 0° to 90°. The limitations of the closure relationship and potential enhancements for future studies are discussed.","2020-07-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:29:47","","107088","","","190","","Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Drift flux model; Drift velocity; High-viscosity oil; Inclined pipes; Multiphase flow; Taylor bubble","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The superficial gas velocity and operating pressure varied from 1 to 35 (cms−1) and 0.1 to 1.0 (MPa), respectively. It was found that the total gas holdup increases with an increase in the operating pressure. The operating flow regime transition point was shifted to higher superficial gas velocities at elevated pressures. The standard deviation of pressure fluctuations was also found to increase with operating pressure but to decrease with the elasticity of the liquid phase.

For plate geometries, one solution for intensifying transfer and increasing residence times is to construct two-dimensional meandering channels. Supported by this scientific context, the present work aims at characterising gas–liquid mass transfer in the same square millimetric meandering channel, as in Anxionnaz (2009), this constituted the preliminary step required for performing exothermic gas–liquid reactions. Firstly, the gas–liquid hydrodynamics were characterised for a water/air system. When compared to a straight channel of identical compactness and sectional-area (2×2mm2), the meandering channel induced (i) a delay in the transition from Taylor to annular-slug regimes, (ii) a rise of 10–20% in bubble lengths while conserving almost identical slug lengths, (iii) higher deformations of bubble nose and rear due to centrifugal forces (bends). Secondly, an original method for verifying the relevancy of the plug flow model and accurately determining kla was used (measurements of concentrations in dissolved oxygen along the channel length). For the Taylor flow regime, kla increased coherently when increasing jg, and the meandering geometry had a small influence. On the contrary, this effect was found no more negligible for the slug-annular flow regime. Whatever the channels, the NTUl remained low, thus showing that, even if millimetric channels allowed to intensify kla, a special attention should be paid for generating sufficient residence times. At identical compactness, the meandering channel was found to be the most competitive. Finally, results on gas–liquid interfacial areas and mass transfer coefficients were confronted and discussed with respect to the predictions issued from the model developed by Van Baten and Krishna (2004).","2011-07-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:30:27","","2974-2990","","13","66","","Chemical Engineering Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Flow structure; Gas–liquid flow regime; Heat-exchanger reactor; Mass transfer coefficient; Meandering millimetric channel; Number of Transfer Units","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it tends to over-read the gas flow rate when directly used to measure the wet gas. How to correct this over-reading and obtain an accurate yet simple wet gas correlation is still one of the challenges in the investigation on the V-Cone throttle device. In this paper, the two-phase mass flow coefficient of the V-Cone throttle device was proposed to correct the deviation of the readings produced by the device. The parameters affecting the coefficient were determined and discussed experimentally. Two V-Cone throttle devices with the respective equivalent diameter ratios of 0.65 and 0.75 were investigated under the condition of the wet gas flow. The test fluid was air and tap water. The gas-to-liquid density ratio ranged from 0.002445 to 0.006083, and the gas densiometric Froude number ranged from 0.3 to 2.0. The influencing parameters including the Lockhart–Martinelli parameter, the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the gas densiometric Froude number and the equivalent diameter ratio were studied. Then the correlations of the two-phase mass flow coefficient and the influencing parameters were proposed for the two V-Cone throttle devices and evaluated experimentally. The results show that the relative deviations of the correlations are less than ±5.0% and the average deviations of the correlations are 2.06% and 2.22% for the V-Cone throttle devices with the equivalent diameter ratio of 0.65 and 0.75, respectively.

These radicals can be used in advanced oxidation processes for water purification. The UV-lamps used in the photochemical reactor lead to a relatively high energy and operating cost. Minimization of these costs is possible via a model-based optimization of the reactor geometry. First, a model is built taking into account the reaction kinetics, the reactor geometry and the radiation intensity distribution in the reactor. Afterwards, two different configurations of photochemical reactors are optimized. The first modeled reactor configuration is a single-lamp reactor and consists of a cylindrical UV-lamp that is present inside a quartz sleeve, outside of which the water flows between it and the external reactor wall (annular channel reactor). A rigorous optimization problem is formulated consisting of the calculation of the optimal reactor geometry (length and radius) in such a way that, for a given reactor volume and a given flow rate of the water to be treated, the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. By solving this optimization problem, it has been shown that an optimal reactor length exists. If the absorption coefficient of the water or the reaction rate constant increases, the optimal reactor length increases as well. The second modeled reactor configuration is similar to the first one but now contains multiple lamps positioned symmetrically in a circular pattern (i.e. multi-lamp reactor). The optimization problem consists of the calculation of the optimal lamp position inside the reactor in such a way that the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. The lamp position is given by the radial distance between the centers of the reactor and a lamp. Again a well-posed optimization problem is obtained and an optimal lamp position exists. If the number of lamps or the reaction rate constant increases or the absorption coefficient of the water decreases, the optimal distance between the centers of the reactor and the lamp increases.","2013-06-07","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:16:24","","174-189","","","96","","Chemical Engineering Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Advanced oxidation processes; Chemical reactors; Mathematical modeling; Multi-lamp photochemical reactor; Optimization; Photochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the wide use of caissons in bridge engineering, until a few years ago this foundation typology has been less investigated than piles and shallow foundations in both static and dynamic field. In most of the published studies, the seismic design of bridge piers was carried out without accounting for soil-structure interaction or by means of an uncoupled approach in which the superstructure was solved independently from the soil-caisson subsystem. In this study, coupled systems made of soil, caisson, pier and deck were analyzed in the time domain by a 3D finite element approach, considering rigid and massive caissons embedded in linear viscoelastic soils. In addition to unravelling the contribution of kinematic and inertial interaction to the total response of the caisson-bridge-pier systems, the study focuses on a particular aspect of kinematic interaction, overlooked in practical design and in most of previous studies, represented by the kinematic bending arising in the bridge pier due to the pier-to-deck joint rigidity. For some critical combinations of soil compliance, caisson geometry, pier height and input motion characteristics, the pier-deck constraint could induce kinematic bending moments in the pier as important as the inertial ones. A closed-form equation was finally proposed to predict the maximum kinematic moment in the bridge pier as a function of the key model parameters identified through the parametric study.","2020-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:28:15","","106341","","","139","","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The densimetric Froude number is used to describe the flow behavior in the coiled tubes in which three different regimes were observed, i.e., homogeneous suspension flow, moving sediment flow, and stagnant sediment. Empirical correlations based on the tube diameter, the mean particle size, the particle mass fraction, the fluid flow rate, the pulsation characteristics of the utilized peristaltic pump, and the physical properties of the system were developed for the critical densimetric Froude number to define the transition between these regimes. Based on this, the particle residence time distributions (RTDS) in the different flow regimes were investigated by step-response experiments from 0 to 1 wt-% of PVC particle tracers in aqueous suspension in a horizontal coiled flow inverter (CFI).

Using similarity theory, the similarity criteria between the aeroelastic model and the prototype have been deduced. A triangular arrangement of three phases is considered, and the arrangements of iced eight-bundled conductors with and without the spacers are divided into six cases. In the experiments, laser sensors at different positions along the span of each phase are used to measure the variation of dynamic displacements with wind speed. Furthermore, galloping characteristics, such as the responses, frequencies, vibration modes, amplitudes and distance between two phases, are obtained for different wind speeds and arrangements. The obtained results show that interphase spacers have a certain inhibitory effect on the first symmetric mode and the first anti-symmetric mode galloping, but not all of the arrangements have a positive effect. The regularity of the variation with wind speed of the anti-galloping effect with interphase spacers is summarized. The galloping amplitude curves indicate that the amplitude is likely to be larger when a modal transformation occurs, in contrast to the results obtained without interphase spacers. The motion of the phase C located close to the diffusion section is different from those of the other two phases.

In this paper, numerical simulation was conducted to get insight into the flow and heat transfer characteristics of supercritical LNG on the tube-side of SCV. The SST model with enhanced wall treatment method was utilized to handle the coupled wall-to-LNG heat transfer. The thermal–physical properties of LNG under supercritical pressure were used for this study. After the validation of model and method, the effects of mass flux, outer wall temperature and inlet pressure on the heat transfer behaviors were discussed in detail. Then the non-uniformity heat transfer mechanism of supercritical LNG and effect of natural convection due to buoyancy change in the tube was discussed based on the numerical results. Moreover, different flow and heat transfer characteristics inside the bend tube sections were also analyzed. The obtained numerical results showed that the local surface heat transfer coefficient attained its peak value when the bulk LNG temperature approached the so-called pseudo-critical temperature. Higher mass flux could eliminate the heat transfer deteriorations due to the increase of turbulent diffusion. An increase of outer wall temperature had a significant influence on diminishing heat transfer ability of LNG. The maximum surface heat transfer coefficient strongly depended on inlet pressure. Bend tube sections could enhance the heat transfer due to secondary flow phenomenon. Furthermore, based on the current simulation results, a new dimensionless, semi-theoretical empirical correlation was developed for supercritical LNG convective heat transfer in a horizontal serpentine tube.

For the numerical simulations, a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package – FLUENT – is used. The rupture distance predictions obtained with both models are compared with experimental data and a reasonable agreement is found. The results of the numerical investigations show that for simulations with negligible viscous, inertial, and gravitational effects, the rupture distance approaches an asymptotic value, which is close to the value predicted by the simplified model. The bridge profiles predicted using the simplified model and the numerical simulation are compared.

First, a web girder section constructed in two different scales, 1/1 and 1/4, is subjected to the impact of a rigid indenter at mid span. The second experiment employs a more complex structure: a head-on collision of a 1/100 scaled tanker against a rigid obstacle. Special attention is given to some similarity complications that are frequent in real tests: model yielding stress different from the prototype and material strain rate. Since the standard similarity laws are unable to deal with those issues, it is shown how to modify the scaling factors to generate a replica similar to the corresponding prototype. Results are shown that support the approach with the modified scaling factors producing a behavior closer to the full-size structure. In the study of the ship head-on collision, only a 1/100 scaled specimen could be tested. In this case, the equivalent prototype was calculated with the assistance of the scaling factors and compared with empirical formulations found in the literature. The methodology depicted in this manuscript can be used as a guidance for scaled impact tests of vessels and other types of large structures.","2017-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:29:00","","149-161","","","110","","International Journal of Impact Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scaling; Ship collision; Similarity; Structural impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interspersed between the large voids are the densified lumps of sinter which are released on crushing and used as blast furnace feed. The bed transformation process is critical in sintering and is an outcome of the work done on the material by the surface and opposing viscous forces. Less densified, weaker sinter forms when the level of coalescence achieved is low. The process is extremely complex in that it involves a three-phase melt–solids–gas system. In this study, the composition of the sinter bed was simulated using the pressed cylinders of laboratory grade chemicals and the coalescence process was studied by characterising the densification of the cylinders. The alumina, magnesia and basicity of the cylinders were altered (1–4%, 0–2% and 0–3, respectively) to change the properties of the melt and also its solid content. The estimation of solid–melt content, melt composition, viscosity and surface tension was obtained using a thermodynamic model (FactSage) and the reported equations in the literature. Using these results Laplace number of the system was determined as a function of temperature. At the completion of some tests the cooled solidified samples were studied under a microscope. The experimental results showed that the higher sinter density and densification factor were obtained when temperature and sinter mix basicity increased and alumina levels decreased. The effect of magnesia level on densification was less because the porosity of the cylinders altered with magnesium carbonate levels. The trends obtained in sinter densification are consistent with the micro-structural information indicated by optical micrographs. The use of Laplace number to quantify the relative influence of the surface to viscous forces on coalescence was encouraging with a prediction error within ±10%. It was also concluded that the most influential factor determining densification factor was the apparent viscosity of the molten mix as the change in surface force was comparatively small.","2016-04-10","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:27:05","","56-68","","","149","","International Journal of Mineral Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coalescence; Densification; Flow characteristics; Iron ore sintering; Laplace number; Molten mix","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the inevitable annular gap between plunger and tube wall, the liquid above the plunger may leak downward during lifting process. How to model and reduce the liquid leakage flow rate is still challenging to optimize the plunger lift method. In this paper, the geometric and operating parameters affecting the liquid leakage in plunger lifting process were determined and discussed. Seven different diameter ratios between plungers and tube of 0.90–0.98 were investigated experimentally, and the optimal diameter ratio (0.96) was obtained. Based on the force balance over plunger and liquid column, a physical model for the liquid leakage during plunger lifting process was proposed. Combining the experimental data of pressure loss in tube, a dimensionless correlation of liquid leakage flow rate for the optimal diameter ratio (0.96) was developed. The results showed that the relative deviation of the correlation is less than ±10.0%. The influencing parameters including the Euler number of liquid, the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the gas and liquid Froude number, the liquid Reynolds number, and the ratio of lifting distance and loading liquid height were studied. The decrease of the initial differential pressure of liquid column and the increase of the gas production mass flow rate make positive contributions to reduce the liquid leakage flow rate during lifting process.","2018-01-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:35:36","","32-40","","","49","","Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gas wells; Liquid leakage flow rate; Liquid loading; Plunger lift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An acoustic resonator is designed as a cavity split in two equal sub-cavities by the membrane of a loudspeaker. Each sub-cavity is connected to the quiescent ambient by a cylindrical nozzle (a pipe) thus two circular synthetic jets in phase opposition are obtained. The influence of jets interaction has been evaluated by varying the jet-axes-distance (1.1, 3 and 5 nozzle diameters) at a fixed operating condition (Reynolds number equal to 6700 and Strouhal number equal to 0.046); the jets pulsating frequency is kept equal to the sub-cavities resonance frequency and the results are compared with those of the single circular synthetic jet in the same conditions. The flow is characterized with PIV phase averaged measurements. Results for the single synthetic jet are in good agreement with the ones present in the literature and a potential core region is defined for the phase averaged flow field of synthetic jets. Twin circular synthetic jets at jet-axes-distance equal to 3 and 5 diameters show the same behavior with respect to the single circular synthetic jet. Differently, strong interaction effects are seen at jet-axes-distance equal to 1.1 diameters: in particular a double vortex ring structure is visualized. This causes a different velocity distribution in the jet core, higher axial velocities and a lower jet width.","2013-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:19:15","","41-52","","","44","","International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Jet flows; Phase locked measurements; PIV; Synthetic jets; Vortex ring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, statistically rigorous models of propped fracture conductivity are developed using a database of fracture conductivity experiments reported in technical literature over the last 40 years. The database contains about 2700 data points. Propped fracture conductivity is the dependent variable and proppant type, mesh size, proppant concentration, formation hardness, closure stress, formation temperature, and polymer concentration are the independent variables. The full, original database was pared down to various subsets, each having complete information in relation to some subset of the independent variables. The number of independent variables included in each of the resulting databases varied from three to six. Seventy percent of the data was used to develop the models while thirty percent of the data was used to validate them. Fixed effect models were selected using all subsets regression analysis in three, four, and five experimental factors for each of two types of proppant. The five factor model appeared to be the most useful model for both proppant types from a predictive point of view. Five-factor model predictions also compared favorably with an existing propped fracture conductivity model and different case histories published in literature. This project provides engineers with access to a propped fracture conductivity database based on experiments reported over the past 40 years in technical literature. The models developed based on this database can be used to generate predictions of propped fracture conductivity for a variety of proppant characteristics and formation conditions. Also, the models presented here are based on data from experimental investigations in different laboratories, potentially reducing biases that may be present in single laboratory investigations.","2019-11-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:29:57","","106280","","","182","","Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fracture conductivity; Regression modeling; Statistical analysis of pooled data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The packing factor increases rapidly with about 5% variation in initial 5 min under strong vibration, which induces approximately 2500 pcm reactivity in reactor core.

The aim is to obtain the drying curves and calculate the effective diffusivity to predict drying kinetics and thermodynamic characteristics of tomatoes drying. The tomato samples were cut in two different shapes namely flat slices and wedges. In the case of flat slices, there were four different thicknesses, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 cm. For the wedged slices, the tomatoes was slit into 2, 4, 8 and 16 equal sections. The moisture content of the tomatoes varied between 92.5 and 93.6%. The tomatoes were weighed regularly until moisture content fell between 18 and 25%. The Fick’s diffusion equation was used to calculate the effective diffusivity from the experimental data by fitting a linear dependency. A new proposed approach from the Arrhenius equation and a literature model were used to determine thermodynamic parameters. The drying operation lasted from 5 h to 21.25 h for flat slices and 8.5 h to 28.25 h for the wedges. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the new proposed approach are compared with the literature model. Evidently, the Gibbs free energy values indicate that tomato solar drying is a spontaneous natural process.","2019-11-15","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:17:28","","164-174","","","193","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Effective diffusivity; Mixed dryer; Thermodynamic parameters; Tomatoes drying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present paper, hydraulic stability of a multi-layer berm breakwater (MLBB) has been studied through varying the parameter of eroded area. To this end, a 2-D experimental model has been carried out in the wave flume of Tarbiat Modares University using irregular waves with a JONSWAP spectrum. A total of 150 tests have been performed to cover a wide range of sea state conditions and geometrical parameters such as wave height, wave period, water depth, berm width, berm elevation, stone class I height, front slope and nominal diameter of stone class I. In this study, a new dimensionless parameter is introduced to indicate that the wave breaking type plays a fundamental role in stability of MLBBs. Eventually; a new formula is derived to estimate the damage of MLBBs, based on different sea state conditions and various geometrical parameters. Comparisons are made between the estimated damage parameter of MLBBs by the proposed formula and those estimated by existing formulae. The results denote that the present formula not only performs well for MLBBs experimental data, but also indicates a reliable performance for some of Lykke Andersen's (2006) data in statically homogenous berm breakwaters (HBBs) outside the range of given formula. Furthermore, an innovative approach is presented to examine the eroded area based on the berm recession and the intersection point of reshaped and initial profile from SWL, which performs faultlessly rather than the existing one.","2020-03-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:17:38","","103599","","","156","","Coastal Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eroded area; Experimental study; Multi-layer berm breakwaters; Waves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testing of the pilot-scale DuraMelter 1200 at the Vitreous State Laboratory at the Catholic University of America has demonstrated that bubbling increases the melt rate of the batch material, and as a result, melter throughput. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of this pilot-scale waste glass melter are being developed to improve our understanding of the processes that occur within the melter to aid in process optimization and troubleshooting of the WTP melters. Unfortunately, model validation is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining suitable experimental data for operational melters due to the inaccessibility for direct observation and measurements of the high-temperature, opaque fluid through the water-jacketed, refractory-lined steel vessel. This study focuses on assessing the fidelity of the CFD models to accurately predict the bubbling behavior. Because of the paucity of experimental data at the resolution required for CFD validation, a code comparison was used to evaluate two common approaches for simulating flows of two immiscible Newtonian fluids on numerical grids and resolving multiphase interfaces. Here, the volume of fluid and level set methods are used to resolve the dynamically evolving interfaces between the molten glass and the air bubbles. To aid in the validation of the results of these codes, a comparison of the bubble behavior, growth, and frequency of bubble generation are presented and a grid convergence study is performed for the two approaches. The predictions from the two codes are within 6% for the average bubble radius of curvature within the bubble channels, within 2% for average terminal rise velocity of the bubbles, and within 4% for the area mean of the local maxima at the free surface. These parameters are of interest since they affect the convection within the melter and at the interface between the glass and batch layer. Ultimately, the results of this work can assist in confirming the predictive ability of waste glass melter models and provide a better understanding of the flow patterns within the WTP melters.","2018-03-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:18:45","","380-392","","","113","","Annals of Nuclear Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bubbling; Computational fluid dynamics; Interface capturing methods; Two-phase flow modeling; Waste glass melter model; Waste vitrification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mean energy dissipation rate of the tank was 1.14m2/s3 and the diameter of the observed mother drops that breakup were mainly in the range of 1–4mm. Multiple breakup events were the most frequent outcome in the experiments. It was observed that the number of daughter drops produced in a breakup was dependent on the mother drop size. The breakup time increased with the mother drop size and was in the approximate range of 10–100ms. A large uncertainty in the measurements is associated with the determination of the final breakup time, particularly in the cases of high order breakup events.

The fluid velocities in the free stream region, which is a clear (from foam) region on the top of foam block, are measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and hot-wire anemometry. The metal foam data are compared to those of solid blocks with the same size. For low blockage ratios, i.e. thin foam layers, the pressure drop caused by a solid block is higher than that of the foam when tested under identical conditions. Interestingly, nonetheless, beyond a threshold blockage ratio value, the pressure drop induced by the metal foam block exceeds that of the solid block of the same height tested at the same air flow rate. This behaviour is best described as the interplay between resistance caused by blockage versus that of the wake forms downstream and over the objects and additional frictional effects within the porous region and on the interface. Furthermore, a correlation, with ±16% deviation, is developed to predict the flow resistance caused by the solid and foam blocks across the partially filled channel.","2018-12-01","2025-07-11 02:54:41","2025-07-11 08:31:03","","117-128","","","99","","Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Laser Doppler Anemometry; Partially filled channel; Porous media; Pressure drop; Velocity profile; Wake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, published literature about the Turgo turbine is limited and indicates that current theory and experimental knowledge do not adequately explain the effects of certain design parameters, such as nozzle diameter, jet inlet angle, number of blades, and blade speed on the turbine's efficiency. In this study, these parameters are used in a three-level (34) central composite response surface experiment. A low-cost Turgo turbine is built and tested from readily available materials and a second order regression model is developed to predict its efficiency as a function of each parameter above and their interactions. The effects of blade orientation angle and jet impact location on efficiency are also investigated and experimentally found to be of relatively little significance to the turbine.

To address these limitations, a new SPT method has been developed based on the representative stress–strain method. By combining dimensional analysis, finite element analysis, and a dimensionless parameter database, this method provides explicit analytical expressions for calculating tensile properties. This present SPT approach is semi-empirical and semi-analytical, which eliminates errors and inconsistencies inherent in traditional empirical correlation methods and offers a more efficient and accurate way to predict tensile properties of steels.

This paper reports a dimensional analysis of a flow-by porous electrode, the main constituent of modern electrochemical flow systems. A step-by-step analysis is carried out starting with 15 primitive variables (including cell voltage as performance measure) and resulting in 7 dimensionless variables only to define the system. The paper goes beyond the reduction of number of variables. Physical significance of the identified dimensionless variables is deliberated to understand the role of underlying transport phenomena in the system, mainly in terms of irreversible losses. Further, the reliability of the dimensionless variables is established by performing scale modeling for an all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) system via virtual experiments. Finally, a functional relationship, in the form of an empirical correlation among the dimensionless variables, is derived that can be utilized for predicting cell voltages of a VRFB system at specific conditions.","2021-12-01","2025-07-11 02:55:05","2025-07-11 08:29:21","","103258","","","44","","Journal of Energy Storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Buckingham’s Pi theorem; Dimensional analysis; Electrochemical flow system; Empirical correlation; Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents an innovative solution by introducing a compact, solar-driven cooling system that integrates a Desiccant Wheel (DW) and a Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC). This novel combination leverages solar energy to enhance cooling efficiency while reducing environmental impact. The system's performance was tested through experimental methods and non-dimensional analysis, which served to validate the TRNSYS simulation. The simulation included custom components representing the DW and TEC's physical characteristics. Results demonstrated that the system effectively reduces air temperature and humidity to maintain thermal comfort, achieving Coefficients of Performance (COP) of 0.94 and 1.13in Toronto and Vancouver, respectively. A key feature of the system is the heat recovery design, which uses waste heat from the TEC to regenerate the desiccant material, enhancing COP by 68%. Further analysis through TRNSYS simulation explored the system's adaptability to various climate conditions by testing a range of temperatures (26–43°C) and relative humidity levels (30–100%).

The validation of the model is done using reliable, frequently used uniaxial fatigue data, culled from the NIMS (National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan) fatigue database on important industrial alloys that experience fatigue loading in service. (No reliable data on such a scale were available to test the validity of this model under multi-axial fatigue loading conditions.) It is demonstrated that the model predicts the experimental results accurately. The accuracy of prediction is examined for every case and compared with that of some other existing methods.

However, the effects of vegetation coverage on the overland flow resistance mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the impact of grass and shrub cover on the resistance to overland flow concerning a random patch distribution pattern. This was achieved through a series of simulated rainfall experiments. Thirty slope surfaces with different vegetation coverages, consisting of complete combinations of five grass and six shrub coverages, were tested under five rainfall intensities (60–120 mm h−1) and three slope gradients (8.75%–26.79%). The results indicated that the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor (f) values on unvegetated slopes ranged from 0.455 to 1.385, whereas those on vegetated slopes ranged from 0.500 to 5.624. Vegetation coverage increased flow resistance on hillslopes, and the relationship between f and the Reynolds number (Re) was influenced by vegetation cover and the slope gradient; thus, it showed a positive correlation when vegetation form resistance was dominant. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed. According to the t-test results, the linear superposition method had limitations in calculating overland flow resistance and was only applicable when the grass coverage was 10%. Moreover, as the coverage increased, significant differences (p < 0.05) emerged between the total resistance and the linear summation of the individual resistance components. Additional vegetation resistance plays a significant role in impeding the water flow, contributing up to 50% of the total resistance. Finally, an equation for calculating additional vegetation resistance was developed using dimensional analysis and multiple nonlinear regression. The accuracy of the equation was validated by comparing it with experimental results (NSE = 0.918, RMSE = 0.144). These findings emphasize the effectiveness of constructing grass-shrub communities and increasing vegetation coverage as measures for soil and water conservation.","2023-11-01","2025-07-11 02:55:05","2025-07-11 08:36:11","","130285","","","626","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additional vegetation resistance; Dimensional analysis; Linear superposition method; Overland flow resistance; Soil erosion; Vegetation cover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a data-driven dimensional analysis methodology is proposed to analyze the stability and reliability of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. The analytical solutions for the largest Lyapunov exponent and the conditional reliability function with minimal arguments are identified. Beginning with random state data, it first discovers the unique and relevant set of dimensionless groups through the Buckingham Pi theorem and sensitivity analysis. The expressions for the quantities of interest (the largest Lyapunov exponent for stability analysis, and the conditional reliability function for reliability assessment) are determined using Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, the dimensionality of these expressions is reduced based on the relative importance of the dimensionless parameter cluster within the unique dimensionless set. The effectiveness and accuracy of this data-driven method for analyzing stochastic stability and reliability are illustrated by two representative numerical examples, i.e., a 2-DOF nonlinear system subjected to purely parametrical Gaussian white noises, and a 2-DOF system subjected to both parametrical and external noises, respectively. Furthermore, the extensionality of the analytical expressions is also validated. The data-driven dimensional analysis methodology specified here overcomes the limitations of classical dimensional analysis and offers more accurate expressions with fewer arguments compared to other data-driven methods found in the existing literature.","2024-04-15","2025-07-11 02:55:05","2025-07-11 08:16:19","","111299","","","212","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data-driven method; Dimensional analysis; Dimensional reduction; Stochastic reliability; Stochastic stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, this thorny problem is solved by adjusting the impact velocity. Based on the mechanisms of different dynamic responses, the similarity laws for the global and local responses of reinforced concrete beams subjected to impact loading are proposed by considering the strain-rate effect of materials through Buckingham Π-theorem, where constitutive models of different materials are employed for inferring dynamic stress. In dimensional analysis, multiple control factors need to be considered simultaneously, such as the strain-rate effects of steel and concrete, since reinforced concrete components are typical composite structures. The similarity law cannot be unified when considering multiple control factors. In view of this, it is recommended to estimate the dynamic response of reinforced concrete components subjected to impact loading through the upper and lower bounds of similarity law. The upper bound of similarity law is based on the strain-rate effect of concrete, while the lower bound of similarity law is based on the strain-rate effect of steel bar. The numerical models of reinforced concrete beams are established based on the experimental background. The numerical simulations with different scaling factors indicate that the model modified by the lower bound of similarity law can better predict the global response of prototype, while the model modified by the upper bound of similarity law can more accurately predict the local response of prototype. In addition, the influence of dynamic elastic modulus of reinforced concrete on the similarity law is discussed through comparative analysis.","2024-12-01","2025-07-11 02:55:05","2025-07-11 08:16:25","","105085","","","194","","International Journal of Impact Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Impact loading; Model test; Reinforced concrete; Similarity law; Structural dynamic response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are particularly adept at estimating relationships between variables that lie within the ranges of values for which they have been trained. Their performance often diminishes when tasked with generating estimates of physical processes that lie outside of the region of the input space covered by the training set. In the case of physical systems, the possible relationships between input and output variables are limited. Dimensional variables can be replaced by a smaller number of dimensionless parameters that enforce physical limitations between dimensional input and output variables. This can be accomplished using dimensional analysis and the Buckingham Pi theorem to enforce or test for dynamic similitude between systems operating at different scales. This process can be exploited for two purposes. The first is to reduce the number of variables correlated by a neural network. The second is to allow a dimensionless neural network to be trained to function as an interpolator between dimensionless input and output parameters even though a neural network trained using dimensional data would be required to extrapolate if the dimensional input variables lie outside of the training set. Using dimensionless data to fit an input-output relationship generalizes better, as compared to using dimensional data, when dynamic similitude between systems has been achieved.

Use of a conventional soxhlet apparatus is limited by the long extraction time to complete a certain quantity of transfer of solute due to inefficient contact between the extractant and solute. A novel design of a modified soxhlet apparatus, including an additional packed column inserted within the soxhlet thimble, is proposed to overcome the limitations. It is evident from the study that cylindrical and annular packed columns (inserted within the thimble) perform better as compared to the elliptical ones. An annular packed bed ensures better oil yield in comparison to the cylindrical one due to enhancement of mass transfer by multiple factors. In order to commercialize the production of juncea seed oil, an effective modeling, based on a comprehensive dimensional analysis (following similarity criteria), is applied for a scale-up. Four key dimensionless groups, namely, soxhlet specific shape factor (Ss), Reynolds number (Res),Froudenumber(Frs) and Peclet number (Pes) are identified. Oil yield is represented by another dimensionless group, soxhlet specific Stanton number (Sts). A multiple-factor regression analysis, using Central Composite Design (CCD) based response surface methodology, is used to develop some rational correlations of various combinations of the dimensionless groups. Necessary and sufficient understanding of the effects of the dimensionless groups [Ss, Res,Frs, and Pes] on the oil yield is important to choose proper scale-up criteria. A novel dimensionless number, the soxhlet number, S, is evolved. S determines the soxhlet performance in terms of oil yield. Maximization of S gives forms a basis of scale-up.

However, the high-dimensional nonlinear characteristics complicate the understanding of the optimization process and increase the difficulty of finding optimal solutions. This study proposes an interpretable reduced-order optimization (ROO) method based on dimensional analysis, which integrates numerous variables into a single reduced-order coefficient through a power form. The goal is to develop a reduced-order and approximately one-dimensional nonlinear relationship during the optimization process and to reveal the mechanisms of single-objective and multi-objective optimization, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the optimization process. The reliability of the ROO is validated through single-objective optimization of building thermal bridges and multi-objective optimization of squirrel cage fans. The study shows that the power in the reduced-order coefficient can be used to determine the sensitivity and impact of design variables on optimization targets. The nonlinear relationship between the composite structural parameters of the building thermal bridge and the total heat flux can be reduced to an approximately one-dimensional linear relationship, significantly reducing the total heat flux of the thermal bridge by 10.3 %. The ROO accurately describes the aerodynamic performance of the fan and its high-dimensional nonlinear relationship with eight design variables, eliminating optimization conflicts among multiple operating conditions and significantly enhancing the aerodynamic performance.

The developed algorithm shows its good accuracy and stability for jet buckling simulation. The numerical results are in good agreement with experimental results obtained by camera directly and short shot experiments. It is found shear rate and gravity have an effect on jet buckling.

In the present study, the blast resistance of the RC slab, the ECC slab, and the composite slab (RC slab reinforced by ECC layer) was investigated and compared through experimental and numerical approaches. Firstly, the material properties of the ECC were acquired through the quasi-static compressive test, as well as quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests, which felicitated the parameter calibration in the K&C model for ECC. Then the numerical models of the RC slab, the ECC slab, and the RC/ECC composite slab were established and validated with the blast test results. The test and numerical results showed that the ECC and composite slabs exhibited superior anti-blast performance in terms of failure mode, damage extent, and load mitigation compared to the RC slab. Owing to the remarkable ductility and toughness, the ECC and composite slabs could greatly reduce the possibility and severity of penetration and spalling damage. Furthermore, five significant parameters impacting the blast resistance of ECC and composite slabs were summarized through dimensional analysis including the tensile strength of ECC σt, the total explosive energy Q, the standoff distance R, the slab thickness H, and the slab span L. Then a dimensionless number was proposed to determine the failure mode and predict the residual deflection at the center of the ECC and composite slabs.

The numerical results obtained in multiphysics modeling of magnetophoretic systems were analyzed based on the proposed dimensionless numbers, resulting in a functional relationship for the particle capture efficiency (CE), defined as the ratio of captured particles to all particles injected in the flow. The performance of magnetophoretic systems predicted with the dimensional analysis was verified in comparison with published experimental data. Using dimensional analysis, 12 input parameters determining the particle CE were reduced to 3 dimensionless numbers characterizing the ratios of magnetophoretic and hydrodynamic forces, cross-sectional areas of the magnet and the flow channel, and length and diameter of the magnet. A set of curves predicting particle CE was obtained using these dimensionless numbers. A close agreement was found between the CEs predicted by the curves and those obtained in both numerical simulations and experiments where cylindrical magnets were placed in a flow through a cylindrical pipe. This study provides a promising framework for analyzing and predicting performance of various magnetophoretic systems for a range of applications.","2023-12-01","2025-07-11 02:55:06","2025-07-11 08:19:35","","103946","","","193","","International Journal of Engineering Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimensionless number; Magnetic particle transport; Magnetophoretic force; Multiphysics modeling; Scaling law; Stokes’ drag","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation to address complex heat transfer problems in a high-speed rotating turbine disk cavity system, fully considering multiple factors. A theoretical derivation is conducted to fully elaborate the multifactor influencing mechanisms of the system based on similarity criteria and a dimensional analysis method. Notably, a high-speed rotational experimental platform of rotating disk is established to verify the research method's reasonability and the result's accuracy. Furthermore, four dimensionless operation cases are conducted to assess the correlation mechanism of the system performance with a strong rotating flow and heat transfer. The results indicate that the main correlation factors of the disk cavity system performance are the flowing Reynolds number, rotating Mach number, rotating Reynolds number, specific heat ratio, and wall temperature. Moreover, the Rossby number and the swirl ratio are used to evaluate the fluid flow characteristics. With the increase in the flowing Mach number from 0.006 to 0.15 and the rotating Reynolds number from 0.74 × 106 to 14.80 × 106 at 9000 rpm, the Nusselt number on the rotor disk wall enhances to 1639.4 and 1286.9, respectively.

In order to apply these models for control purposes, they require the fitting of a set of model parameters so they can provide an accurate description of the fermentation system. In order to prevent overfitting of the experimental data, the parameter estimation procedures should produce unique estimates with small confidence intervals. This is facilitated by dimensional analysis, a tool that provides proper scaling of the dynamic model, removing its dimensional units. However, it is surprising that fermentation models seldom employ dimensional analysis, although it is recognized as a tool that can reduce the number of parameters and thus facilitate a comparison between different sets of data. In this tutorial review, we develop a systematic approach for dimensionless reformulation applied to fermentation systems. The approach is demonstrated on parameter estimation studies for a non-isothermal CSTR model and two common microbial fermentation state space models. It is shown that the analysis reduces the number of parameters in the models to yield identifiable reparameterizations, increases the accuracy of the parameter estimation, facilitates sensitivity analysis, and it can be stated that model identification and dimensional analysis as two concepts/approaches are complementary to each other. These benefits are relevant for the next stage of process optimization and control implementation.

It accurately predicts effective viscosity in power-law and Newtonian flow regimes, distinguished by distinct asymptotic values at extremely low and high shear rates. However, existing analytical models for determining Carreau's parameters (zero-shear-viscosity, μp∘, power-law index, n, and relaxation-time constant, λ) have limitations. Typically expressed in terms of polymer solution concentration (Cp), these models often overlook critical variables such as solvent salinity (CNaCl), hardness (Cca++), solution density (ρs), and polymer molecular weight (M). Additionally, many of these models lack dimensional consistency. This study introduces a robust scientific method for modeling Carreau's parameters, integrating dimensional analysis with non-linear regression to delineate the factors influencing these parameters. The analysis indicates that the power-law index is primarily influenced by Cp, CNaCl, and Cca++. The zero-shear-viscosity (μp∘) is governed by Cp, CNaCl, Cca++, M, ρs, pressure (P), and n, while the time constant (λ) is mainly determined by Cp, CNaCl, Cca++, n, and μp∘. The derived empirical models demonstrate a direct dependence of zero-shear viscosity on P, M3,ρs6, and an exponential dependence on Cp, aligning with experimental observations. Incorporating variables like solution density, molecular weight, and pressure was crucial for enhancing the precision of μp∘ and λ predictions. These models, validated against rheological measurements of three dilute EOR polymer solutions (HPAM and AMPS-based) in various conditions, have shown superior precision and impartiality compared to prominent existing models, representing a significant advancement in the field.","2024-09-01","2025-07-11 02:55:06","2025-07-11 08:17:37","","114143","","","584","","Fluid Phase Equilibria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carreau's parameters; Dimensional analysis; Polymer; Regression analysis; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A detailed 3D FE model of the soil–foundation–structure (SFS) system is developed and used as a benchmark to assess the efficiency of an enhanced Winkler-based ""Caisson-on-Winkler-Soil"" (CWS) model, where the soil is replaced by nonlinear hysteretic elements. The proposed CWS model captures residual deformations and hysteresis and offers physical coupling between vertical and moment loading. It allows excellent prediction of the H–M failure envelope in the most relevant first quadrant of H–M space, where the loads act in the same direction. Despite its successful application for the simulation of inertial loading, the CWS model fails to reproduce the dual shearing mechanism that develops at the caisson shaft during shaking, stemming from the combination of kinematic soil shearing due to the vertically propagating shear waves, and shearing due to the superstructure inertial response, thus underpredicting the co-seismic caisson settlements. For the prediction of the latter, the research utilizes spectrum compatible input motions and 3D FE models of varying geometric and material properties to derive linear regression equations that correlate the co-seismic dimensionless settlement of caissons (wE/D) with characteristic dimensional variables of the problem under investigation and the Arias Intensity (IA) of the surface ground motion. As a final step, the paper proposes a hybrid method for performance-based assessment of SBJ OWTs.

A novel dynamic sliding mesh method is implemented in OpenFOAM based on the coupling of the sliding mesh and mesh morphing methods. A spring-like mesh motion strategy is proposed. The major advantages of this self-implemented mesh handling method are on accommodation of the large amplitude of the six degree-of-freedom motion of a cylinder (rigid body) and the preservation of the mesh non-orthogonality.

Combined with the physical significance of these dimensionless numbers, the constraints between different parameters and physical fields were analyzed, as well as the influences of dimensionless numbers on the two evaluation indexes of reduction degree and energy consumption. The correlation models between the dimensionless numbers and the reduction degree of iron oxides were obtained by data regression. Since the dimensionless numbers in the correlation models coupled the synergistic influences of multiple parameters on the transport processes, it can not only provide theoretical guidance for the inverse selection of design or operating parameters, but also greatly improve the applicability of the model.","2024-09-01","2025-07-11 02:55:07","2025-07-11 08:27:25","","125714","","","229","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimensional analysis; Dimensionless number; Induction furnace; Iron-rich phase removal; Melting reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finite element models offer the advantage of comprehensively accounting for these effects and the interaction between different failure mechanisms.

Understanding the impact of various physical parameters on critical flow and accurately predicting critical flow mass flux is essential in these processes. This article collects extensive experimental data on subcooled water two-phase critical flow and supplements it with additional experimental data from actual micro-cracked channels, constructing a comprehensive benchmark database. The database covers an inlet pressure range of 1.82–16.29 MPa, an inlet subcooling range of 0.3–119.35 K, and a microchannel hydraulic diameter range of 0.09–2.2 mm. By integrating the classical Buckingham Pi theorem with a data-driven active subspace method, the dominant dimensionless numbers in subcooled water two-phase critical flow were identified, addressing some limitations of the Buckingham Pi theorem by ranking the influences of these dimensionless numbers. Based on these dominant dimensionless numbers, the impact of physical quantities on two-phase critical flow was accurately identified, leading to a concise predictive correlation for critical flow mass flux with a mean absolute percentage error of 20.3 % across 1071 experimental data points, outperforming commonly used critical flow models. Furthermore, leveraging the dominant dimensionless numbers improved existing model results, enhancing the Henry-Fauske model’s overall prediction accuracy from a mean absolute percentage error of 47.6 % to 17.8 %.

By analyzing the damage mechanisms from experimental results, the main modes of energy absorption were identified, and a relatively accurate predictive model for ballistic limit speed was established. The results show that under high-speed steel ball impacts, the primary failure modes of UHMWPE fiber laminated plates are localized permanent bulging plastic deformation and perforation failure caused by compressive shear. The ballistic limit speeds for UHMWPE with thicknesses of 1.1 mm, 2.8 mm, and 5.4 mm are respectively 233.5 m/s, 415.7 m/s, and 602.9 m/s. The theoretical calculations of the energy model align well with the experimental results, indicating that as the speed increases, the proportion of tensile energy absorption gradually decreases, consistent with the observed phenomena. Near the ballistic limit, there are significant turning points in the level of energy absorption and the height of the rear bulge. The ballistic limit increases linearly with target thickness, and the unit area density energy absorption also increases continuously. Finally, this study established a dimensionless ballistic limit model considering the mechanical properties of fibers and the matrix, which through regression analysis, can accurately describe the ballistic limits of various strengths and types of fiber laminated plates, suitable for predicting the ballistic performance of various composite materials.","2024-12-01","2025-07-11 02:55:07","2025-07-11 08:33:43","","112391","","","205","","Thin-Walled Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ballistic impact; Composites; Damage mechanism; Dimensional analysis; Energy dissipation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The time-varying pressure difference across the aqueduct corresponding to a given oscillatory flow rate is measured in parametric ranges covering the range of flow conditions commonly encountered in healthy subjects. Parametric dependences are delineated for the time-averaged pressure fluctuations and for the phase lag between the transaqueductal pressure difference and the flow rate, both having clinical relevance. The results are validated through comparisons with predictions obtained with a previously derived computational model. The parametric quantification in this study enables the derivation of a simple formula for the relation between the transaqueductal pressure and the stroke volume. This relationship can be useful in the quantification of transmantle pressure differences based on non-invasive magnetic-resonance-velocimetry measurements of aqueduct flow for investigation of CSF-related disorders.","2024-05-01","2025-07-11 02:55:25","2025-07-11 08:31:12","","180-191","","","105","","European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cerebral aqueduct; Cerebrospinal fluid; Interventricular pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a remarkable number of correlations exist for systems at low (atmospheric) pressures, accurately quantifying heat transfer under high-pressure transcritical conditions poses a notable challenge, especially at low Reynolds numbers due to the scarcity of correlations available in the literature. This difficulty has prompted the widespread use of general empirical correlations, which are inadequate for such flow conditions, and hold significant implications, for instance, in fields like microfluidics technology. In this regard, the aim of this study is to develop novel heat transfer correlations tailored for high-pressure transcritical fluids at relatively low Reynolds numbers. These correlations are derived from a dataset of 18 direct numerical simulations of carbon dioxide confined between differentially heated walls, which induce a transcritical trajectory through the pseudo-boiling region. The correlations are developed for both the cold liquid-like and hot gas-like regions, resulting in a total of 6 correlations that encompass the laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. In particular, as a function of Reynolds, Prandtl, Eckert and Mach numbers, the proposed empirical correlations provide accurate estimations with relative errors below 8%, which significantly surpass existing literature correlations.","2024-10-01","2025-07-11 02:55:25","2025-07-11 08:15:04","","125837","","","231","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Empirical correlations; Heat transfer; Laminar & turbulent flow; Supercritical fluids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While PBF processes are attractive due to their ability for realizing complex structures that are either difficult or impossible to create through conventional means, the parts fabricated with these techniques can exhibit defects such as pores, inclusions, and excessive surface roughness. To minimize these defects, much research has been dedicated towards process maturation by optimizing laser or electron beam parameters. However, these developmental efforts typically do not address the recoating process where achieving dense and uniform layers of powder is a necessity for ensuring process repeatability and part quality. While the recoating process can be studied through experimentation, the dynamics of particle movement are difficult to analyze experimentally. Therefore, in this study, powder spreading in PBF was simulated through the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to elucidate the mechanisms that control powder-bed quality. Utilizing the Buckingham Pi theorem, a dimensionless metric referred to as the spreading index is developed that combines powder-bed density, roughness, and particle size to assess the quality of powder layers. The formulated spreading index is then related to several dimensionless quantities that provide insight into the mechanisms dominating powder spreading in PBF. The DEM simulations conducted in this work focused on the scenario where powder is spread onto an existing powder bed and revealed that a reduction in the recoating velocity causes an increase in the spreading index while little to no impact on the spreading index was observed when varying layer thickness from 30 µm to 75 µm. Particle size effects on the powder-bed quality were also investigated.","2024-07-25","2025-07-11 02:55:25","2025-07-11 08:31:51","","104345","","","92","","Additive Manufacturing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additive manufacturing; Discrete element method; Powder spreading process; Powder-bed fusion; Spreadability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, three typical fracture modes of explosively-driven metal shells–tensile fracture, tensile-shear fracture and shear fracture are numerically revealed by using both the maximum principal strain and the Johnson-Cook cumulative-damage failure criterion. The selection of failure criteria is explained in detail. The fracture strain and fragment morphology are in good agreement with the experimental results. Combined with failure criterion, the numerical results are analyzed from the perspective of pressure, stress and strain. It is found that the formation of different fracture modes depends on the competition between the shear failure formed in the inner surface of the shell and the tensile micro-cracks formed in the middle of the shell. To further investigate the influencing factors of different fracture modes, three dimensionless parameters affecting the fracture modes are proposed based on dimensional analysis.

Fixed water measuring flumes have a high construction cost and are prone to causing local channel sedimentation, compromising the safety of channel water transmission and flow measurement accuracy. Portable water measuring flumes can be used repeatedly in channels within a certain contraction ratio, and the duration of one water measurement is short (generally less than 5 min), which will not cause sedimentation. A new portable primary and subsidiary fish-shaped flume has been proposed by dividing 1 fish-shaped cylinder into 3. The flow measurement and hydraulic performance of measuring flumes with different contraction ratios in a U-shaped channel under different working conditions were studied using prototype experiments and numerical simulation. Compared to the existing portable flume, the primary and subsidiary fish-shaped flumes have achieved high flow measurement accuracy, a large critical submergence degree, a low backwater height, and low head loss.

Firstly, the vibration source function is formed based on the mechanical model of the mobile vibration source of high-speed railway trains, and the vibration wave of high-speed railway trains is numerically simulated.

Existing similitude methods choose isentropic efficiency as the similitude parameter, which cannot take into account all the impact factors (e.g. the real-gas effect) in the performance conversion, thus resulting in limited applications. In this paper, the similitude parameter for efficiency is theoretically deduced by analyzing the essential polytropic compression process. It is proved that polytropic efficiency serves as a more unified similitude parameter than isentropic efficiency. On this basis, a unified performance conversion method is first proposed and then validated.

Based on the FE model, the individual effects of the peak overpressure and positive impulse on the cutting performance were revealed. The experimental results demonstrated that either a decreasing scaled distance or an increasing charge mass resulted in a larger cutting strain. The numerical solutions indicated that similar changing tendencies to cutting strain were observed for the cutting plateau stress and energy absorbed by the combined honeycomb.

Detection and characterization of the pulse-like features are fundamental in seismic hazard analysis, ground motion selection/simulation, and structural analysis. From the perspective of earthquake engineering, a pulse-like feature in a ground motion is of significance only if it dominates certain structural response to the ground motion. In order to identify such kind of pulse-like features, the current study establishes the so-called response spectra associated with various velocity waveforms through dimensional analysis of structural response to a generic velocity pulse. The congruence and the shifts between the ΠPV and the pseudo-velocity response spectra associated with identical velocity waveform allow automatic detection of velocity pulses through adaptive similarity search in bi-logarithmic spectrum curves. Following this approach, velocity pulses are detected and characterized in hundreds of historical ground motion records. The majority of the detection results are comparable to the velocity pulses identified through wavelet analysis in literature, while significant differences are noticed for a few cases. Further investigation shows our approach is able to capture the velocity pulse that retains the impulsive effect of the original ground motion on structures and thus provides a worthy supplement to the existing pulse identification methods.","2021-10-01","2025-07-11 02:55:26","2025-07-11 08:32:01","","106626","","","149","","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Curve similarity; Dimensional analysis; Near-fault ground motion; Pulse detection; Velocity pulse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve this problem, the improved dimensional analysis method and the finite element software ANSYS are used to study similar relationships and derive the design model of a certain bridge. Within the elastic similarity criteria, effective and feasible test models are proposed. The distortion model is designed by increasing the added mass can reduce the time scale, guarantee that the test runs smoothly, and better reflect the dynamic response of the prototype structure after such modification, however, for the long and thin model structure, the appropriate added mass adopted to ensure that within the bearing capacity of the structure and the shaking table, the elastic similarity meets the design requirements of the structure model of irregular and regular cross-sections and is suitable for the model design requirements of long-span and large-scale structures. Within the elasticity-gravity similar criteria, the distortion model designed by added mass can reflect the dynamic response of the prototype structure, which needs to be configured with certain added masses, and the bearing capacity of the model itself and the shaking table needs to be considered. The elasticity-gravity similitude law is suitable for examining regular cross-sections and short-span and small-scale test models, but the fluid-structure coupling and failure mechanism of structures can be examined. The distinctive peak acceleration will not affect the error of the dynamic response of the lacking-artificial added mass model, the distortion model and the prototype. The reinforcement ratio will not affect the error of the dynamic response of the distortion model and the prototype structure, but it will affect the error of the dynamic response of the lacking-artificial added mass model and the prototype structure. The added mass of the water triggered by the flexible movement of the structure under the action of earthquake changes the dynamic characteristics of the structure and the rigid movement of the structure triggers the water to exert an external force on the structure, which affects the dynamic characteristics and responses of the structure.

The applied assessment methodology is based on wall-resolving large eddy simulations and analytical considerations, exemplified by diamond-water nanofluids of different particle concentrations. It is observed that a change in heat transfer due to nanoparticles is affected by two competing mechanisms. On the one hand, the modified thermo-physical properties of the suspension obviously favor heat transfer. On the other hand, an addition of particles drastically dampens turbulence which causes the opposite effect. At fixed energy input by the pump, the second effect usually dominates, so that the performance of the nanofluid deteriorates compared to the carrier fluid without particles. In other words, increasing the turbulence intensity of the carrier fluid is more efficient to transfer a certain amount of thermal energy than using nanofluids.

Limited case studies show satisfactory performance of the PM to represent dynamics of such blocks both in unidirectional and bidirectional excitations. Subsequently, the dynamics of the 3D prism has been studied under trigonometric pulses. Interestingly, it appears that, under bidirectional shaking, the body may rotate about its own longitudinal axis and, due to this spin, the body may ‘walk’ from its original position even when sufficient friction at the interface prevents sliding. This residual displacement of the body under no sliding condition could not be recognized from 2D analysis. Using principles of dimensional analysis, self-similarity in response for complex nonlinear motions of the rocking oscillators has been established.

Therefore, the corrected relationship between strain-rate effect and specific impulse is derived by dimensional analysis. The exponential function presented by Oshiro and Alves is adopted to establish the corrected formula for the distorted thickness model, in which the surface effect is taken into account for alleviating the deviation caused by the manufacturing procedure. Based on the test data, which Rigby measured in the buried explosion, a set of revised empirical formulas for calculating the relationship between the specific impulse and the mass of explosives is determined. Moreover, by these models, one can predict the mid-point deflection of plates subjected to landmine explosion. Given all this, a rapid solution to predict the behavior of the prototype is presented in this paper.

The temperature field of the engine core was numerically solved by applying the finite difference method (FDM) to the energy equation, and also compared with CFD results. To systematically clarify the heat transfer characteristics of the oscillatory flow in the engine core, dimensional analyses for the associated geometries and physical values were performed, and nondimensional parameters were selected to determine the heat transfer characteristics. The simulation was performed using these nondimensional parameters, and the correlations of local Nusselt number distributions and some nondimensional parameters were considered. Based on the correlations among heat transfer characteristics, a model was constructed for predicting the temperature gap between the wall and the fluid at the edge of a regenerator.

The fractures may form at various scales, particularly within geological or cementitious materials like rock and concrete. Understanding and simulating accurately the fracturing processes at different scales, from laboratory to field, assists with the optimization of structural design and enhances reliability. This paper proposes novel non-dimensional scaling laws for fracture mechanics problems. They improve the prediction and interpretation of crack initiation and evolution and the subsequent mechanical response of structures. They have direct applicability in advanced numerical models like phase field models, where the governing parameters and mesh sizes can be appropriately scaled prior to conducting the numerical simulation. This leads to a unique dimensionless model output for any given loading configuration. Rescaling the unique non-dimensional output, which may incorporate varying pre-peak and post-peak fracture resistances, allows for the fracture behavior of a structure at any scale to be determined. The non-dimensionalization and rescaling techniques are demonstrated and validated against independent analytical and experimental benchmark problems. The scaling laws enable the adoption of coarse meshes in numerical models, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy and capturing the fundamental mechanics. It is shown that the challenges associated with modeling fracture processes across scales can be mitigated as long as the problem is appropriately scaled.","2024-02-21","2025-07-11 02:55:27","2025-07-11 08:35:16","","109854","","","297","","Engineering Fracture Mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimensional analysis; Fracture mechanics; Phase-field method, Scaled boundary finite element method; Scaling laws","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For each species, the available measurements were carried out by Freeman et al. with plants having different values of plant density, height, and bending stiffness.

In particular, 46 measurements were used to calibrate the relationship between the scale factor Γ of the velocity profile, the Froude number, and the channel slope. This relationship was calibrated using the entire available dataset or varying the scaling coefficient a with the investigated vegetation type. The measured values of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, obtained by the measured flow velocity, water depth and slope values, were compared with those calculated by the theoretical flow resistance law, coupled with the relationship for estimating the Γ function having a scaling coefficient different for each investigated vegetation type.

To study the propagation law of ground shock parameters in concrete, free-field tests of explosions at seven different scaled depth of burial (SDOB) have been carried out by using self-constructed concrete blocks with large-sizes. The results indicate that when the SDOB ranges from −0.25 to 1.2 m/kg1/3, the pressure and acceleration at the same scaled distance from the explosion center increase with the SDOB. When the SDOB reaches 1.2 m/kg1/3, the explosion energy is completely enclosed into underground, and the coupling coefficient reaches 1.0. Combined with the dimensional analysis theory, it is found that when the SDOB of an explosion is determined, the propagation law of pressure and acceleration presents a power function attenuation with the increase of the scaled distance from the explosion center. For the three different strength grades of C30, C50, C70 concrete under semi-buried explosion, the attenuation gradient of the pressure or acceleration is inconsistent with an increase in the scaled distance from the explosion center. The higher the concrete strength, the slower the gradient changes. By introducing the depth of burial (DOB) coefficient of equivalent energy, the prediction method of ground shock parameters at different SDOB of explosion and explosions with different mass of charge can be obtained, and it has high accuracy for calculating the ground shock parameters of explosion with large mass charge which verified by numerical simulation.","2021-07-12","2025-07-11 02:55:27","2025-07-11 08:28:13","","123372","","","291","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acceleration; Concrete; Depths of burst; Explosion mechanics; Pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The distinct feature of the framework is that the newly proposed oriented dimensions, dimensionless numbers and scaling factors for all basic physical quantities are explicitly expressed by three characteristic lengths of spatial directions, which overcomes the inherent defects only with one scalar length in the traditional dimensional analysis. Meanwhile, similarity laws of the directional stresses, strains and displacements are expressed by different power law relationships of the ratios of undistorted characteristic lengths to distorted characteristic lengths. Therefore, the ability of similarity theory to express structural geometric characteristics are effectively developed. Based on the newly proposed framework, the non-scalabilities of geometric and material distortion (including strain hardening and strain rate effects) and the gravity effects could be compensated by correction methods of velocity, density and geometry. The analytical models of beams subjected to impact mass and impulsive velocity are verified. The results show that the proposed framework has excellent performance for expressing various dimensionless response equations and geometrically distorted scaling. A numerical model of circular plate subjected to dynamic pressure pulse is further carried out to verify the geometrically distorted scaling of the directional components of displacement, strain and stress. The refined analysis results show that, structural dimensionless responses in different directions can behave good consistency between the scaled model and the prototype in both the spatial and the temporal fields, with the correction of the directional physical quantities using different powers of the ratios of characteristic lengths.","2022-03-01","2025-07-11 02:55:27","2025-07-11 08:33:18","","104092","","","161","","International Journal of Impact Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimension; Geometric distortion; Response number; Scaling; Similarity; Structural impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model takes into account the porous heating surface characteristics (porosity, pore diameter, and thickness), the working fluid thermophysical properties, and its interaction. The model was developed based on the experimental database obtained by the authors and validated with the open literature database.

Labyrinth weir as a nonlinear weir with a folded crest enhances the spillway system discharge capacity by increasing the crest length for a given channel width. As a remarkable parameter, the discharge coefficient plays an important role in determining weirs' passing capacity. So, it is important that the discharge coefficient be accurately represented to ensure an appropriate and economical design. This research evaluates the prediction accuracy of four soft computing techniques, such as support vector machines (SVM), gene expression programming (GEP), software (QNET), and artificial intelligence networks (ANN), to predict the discharge coefficient of labyrinth weirs using three different scenarios. The model's input parameters included the total water head ratio (HT/P), magnification (Lc/W), and cycle wall angle (α). On reviewing the outcomes of the developed models, it appeared that each of them demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting the discharge coefficient. However, ANN and SVM reveal more accuracy compared to other techniques. The prediction results reveal that the ANN as a superior model has the following performance metrics: R2 = 0.998, DC coefficient = 0.996, and RMSE = 0.006. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that HT/P is the most effective factor in determining the labyrinth weir discharge coefficient in all methods. This suggests that the ratio of HT (total water head) to P (weir height) has a significant impact on the overall model performance. Upon comparing the results of this research with those of other researchers, it is evident that the evaluation indicators for all methods employed in this study are relatively superior.","2024-04-01","2025-07-11 02:55:27","2025-07-11 08:27:35","","102563","","","96","","Flow Measurement and Instrumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Discharge coefficient; Labyrinth weir; Meta models; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sheets need to overcome the van der Waals attractive forces as well as the π−π interactions to form stable dispersions. The use of surfactants can resolve this issue but compromises the properties of GNP and therefore requires additional processing steps. In this work, we utilize graphene oxide as a dispersing agent in the liquid phase exfoliation of GNP from raw graphite. We first analyze the exfoliation process and determine that the relevant process parameters are graphene oxide and graphite concentration, graphite sheet size, dynamic viscosity of the dispersion, shear rate, and exfoliation time. Applying dimensional reasoning reduces the problem to four non-dimensional groups. A set of experiments, guided by a factorial design, is undertaken to analyze the exfoliated content using UV–Vis spectroscopy. We achieve a high GNP concentration of 8.6 mg ml−1, corresponding to a yield of 23 wt%, after a relatively-short exfoliation time of around 3 h. This is a considerably better performance compared to other liquid phase exfoliation processes. Experimental results are used to derive a functional correlation between the dimensional groups, which can be used for optimization. Additionally, we use exfoliated graphene dispersions to synthesize graphene hydrogels as electrode material for flexible aqueous supercapacitors. We measure a capacitance of 206 F g−1 and 143 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g −1, respectively.

The strategy of proposed partial similarity method by considering different principle parameters combinations for various collapse modes could give close results between the full and small scale models, which would be a good option for designing testing models.","2021-01-01","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:33:53","","108294","","","219","","Ocean Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Experiment; Finite element analysis; Ship; Similarity analysis; Stiffened panel; Ultimate strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a systematic review and discussion of 1-g physical modeling relevant to pile-reinforced reservoir landslides. Various aspects, from the theoretical basis (i.e., principle of similitude) to experimental details (i.e., model construction, test technique, and data acquisition and interpretation), are investigated. The principle of similitude and application in the physical modeling of pile-reinforced reservoir landslides are discussed. Factors causing distortions in a 1-g physical landslide model are discussed, and measures for distortion control are proposed.

Consequently, CCs reinforced with GDs (CRGDs) can serve a variety of applications in the construction industry. Despite several experimental studies on the conductivity of CRGDs, finite element (FE) models have rarely been developed to investigate the conductivity of CRGDs. Previous FE models primarily focused on one-dimensional fillers like carbon nanotubes within polymeric matrices, overlooking the distinctive anisotropic behaviour of GDs in cementitious matrices. This study introduces a computational micromechanics model (CMM), integrating the representative elementary volume (REV) concept with FE analysis, to investigate the electrical conductivity of CRGDs. This model is particularly noted for its computational efficiency, as it converts the problem dimensions from 3D to 2D while ensuring an acceptable degree of accuracy. The CMM captures the anisotropic conductivity of GDs and includes critical conductivity mechanisms such as conductive pathways, the tunnelling effect, and field emission. Subsequently, REV size sensitivity analysis is performed to ensure the statistical relevance of the REV, followed by the model's validation against experimental data from the literature. Afterwards, the model's sensitivity analysis clarifies how different parameters, including the constituent properties, influence prediction results. The sensitivity analysis results suggest that the aspect ratio of GDs has considerable impacts on the electrical conductivity and the percolation threshold of CRGDs. Ultimately, this study aims to provide insights into the optimization and design of electrically conductive CRGDs and lay the foundation for future research in this area.","2024-08-09","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:28:06","","137162","","","438","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cementitious composites; Electrical conductivity; Finite element model; Graphene derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study reviews recent advances in Mechanistic-AI, defined as a methodology that combines the raw mathematical power of AI methods with mechanism-driven principles and engineering insights. Mechanistic-AI solutions are systematically analyzed for three aspects of manufacturing processes, i.e., modeling, design, and control, with a focus on approaches that can improve data requirements, generalizability, explainability, and capability to handle challenging and heterogeneous manufacturing data. Additionally, we introduce a corpus of cutting-edge Mechanistic-AI methods that have shown to be very promising in other scientific fields but yet to be applied in manufacturing. Finally, gaps in the knowledge and under-explored research directions are identified, such as lack of incorporating manufacturing constraints into AI methods, lack of uncertainty analysis, and limited reproducibility and established benchmarks.

Although a considerable body of experimental observations at the bench scale (on the order of 1 cubic foot) show promise, there remains considerable uncertainty in how the process may scale to the field. This work characterizes the relationship between the extent and intensity of fracturing and the duration and strength of the dynamic load. Our approach uses a direct numerical simulation of the elastodynamic equations while accounting for nonlinear fracture mechanics. A hybrid Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) is applied whereby cohesive (elastoplastic) laws hold mesh elements together until complete failure. Beyond failure, elements act as deformable free bodies that can interact via contact constraints, including friction. The consistency of the model is first verified and it is validated with observations from previously reported physical experiments. Subsequently, we apply the model to conduct a numerical exploration of the dimensionless parameter space that defines plausible loading waveforms. We model an infinite domain that contains a spherical inclusion within which various impulsive loads are applied. The dynamic loading waveform is parameterized by its rise time to peak stress, followed by a decay period, and occurring within micro- to milliseconds. The dimensionless parameter space is sampled by varying loading characteristics (rise time, peak pressure, and impulse) to reveal the stimulated damaged bulk volume and crack intensity. Consistent with reported experimental observations, the model reproduces a nearly linear trend between the radius of damage and the maximum stress on the bench scale. Beyond that scale, however, the model predicts that this scaling slows considerably to a fractional power law between the damaged radius and the peak stress. This limitation coincides with a geometric increase in the intensity of damage within the stimulated volume. We present loci curves of the expected damage radii as functions of the loading waveform properties.","2024-01-01","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:16:06","","105613","","","173","","International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Blasting; Dynamic fracturing; FDEM; Pulsed power; Waterless stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this process, forging effect induced by impact of large-size hard micro-forging particles to in-situ densification of the deposited materials. Therefore, a fully dense metallic deposit could be produced at moderate gas temperature and pressure without using expensive helium gas. However, it is found that the porosity is highly dependent on the type of depositing materials, shot-penning particle size, and spraying parameters. Shot-peening particle deposition-induced inclusion is frequently observed for soft depositing materials. This makes the application challenging and a universal processing map is in great demand. In this study, pure Al, pure Ti, pure Ni, 2219 Al, 6061 Al, 7055 Al, and TC4 with different hardness values are used as examples to explore a universal spraying processing map for MFCS. The influence of impact velocity and volume fraction of the shot-peening particle, types of the depositing materials, and spraying parameter on densification and shot-peening particle deposition is investigated. Adding 30 vol. % of 410 stainless steel MF particles into the depositing powders decreases the porosity of all deposits and particle deposition-induced inclusion is observed in pure Al, all three Al alloys, and pure Ti deposits. The single particle deposition experiment and the numerical simulation reveal that mechanical interlocking is the prime mechanism for MF particle deposition. A critical embedding MF particle size (dcr,e), above which MF particle inclusion can be avoided, is defined. A new concept of MF intensity (IMF) is proposed to comprehensively consider all main factors influencing the densification of the deposit.

The Buzi landslide was one of the two largest landslides triggered by the 2013 Minxian–Zhangxian Ms. 6.6 earthquake and resulted in two deaths. Field investigations showed that it was a loess–mudstone landslide with a short sliding distance (approximately 20 m). By simplifying the original site conditions of the landslide, a model slope was built to perform a large-scale shaking table test. The dynamic response of the model was investigated in the time–frequency–energy space using the Hilbert–Huang transform method, and the failure mechanism was clarified from an energy perspective. The Hilbert spectrum indicates that the distribution characteristics of the instantaneous frequency energy are completely different between the loess layer and mudstone layer. Under 0.06 g, large energy is mainly concentrated in a frequency range 10–40 Hz in the loess layer, whereas the energy is mainly concentrated in the 5–10 Hz range in the mudstone layer. This implies that complex reflection and refraction waves occurred in the loess layer. With the increase in intensity, the energy in the loess layer gradually concentrates in the 5–10 Hz range, suggesting that the absorption capacity of the loess layer for high-frequency energy from the relative movement of soil particles increased. The marginal spectra changed from single peak to multipeak with increase in elevation under 0.06 g and changed from multipeak to single peak (with a predominant frequency of approximately 5.6 Hz) with increase in intensity, demonstrating that elevation (>1/2H) can amplify the high-frequency cumulative energy under 0.06 g, showing that input seismic energy gradually takes dominance. Large cumulative energy (10–40 Hz) and instantaneous energy are mainly distributed at the slope shoulder and loess layer. This causes the formation of cracks and a sliding surface in the loess layer. The failure phenomenon of the model slope is close to that of the Buzi landslide, in which sliding occurred at the middle–upper part of the slope within the loess layer.","2022-06-05","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:16:17","","106630","","","302","","Engineering Geology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dynamic response; Failure mechanism; Hilbert–Huang transform method; Large-scale shaking table test; Loess–mudstone landslide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SFT is particularly useful in the study of unconventional aircraft configurations as their behaviour cannot be reliably predicted based on legacy aircraft designs. In this paper, we survey the evolution of various design approaches (from 1848 to 2021) used to ensure similitude between a sub-scale model and its full-scale counterpart, which is an essential requirement to effectively perform SFT. Next, we present an exhaustive list of existing sub-scale models used in SFT and analyse the key trends in their design approaches, test-objectives, and applications. From this review, we conclude that the state-of-the-art sub-scale model design methods available in literature have not been used extensively in practice. Furthermore, we argue that one sub-scale model is not sufficient to predict the complete flight behaviour of a full-scale aircraft, but a catalog of tailored sub-scale models is needed to predict full-scale behaviour. An introduction to the development of such a catalog is presented in this paper, but the development of a formal methodology remains an open challenge. Establishing an approach to develop and use a SFT catalog of models to predict full-scale aircraft behaviour will help engineers enhance confidence on their designs and make SFT a viable and attractive testing method in the early stages of design.","2022-04-01","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:30:02","","100798","","","130","","Progress in Aerospace Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classical similitude theory; Computational scaling; Flight dynamics assessment; Governing equations based similitude; Sub-scale Flight Testing (SFT); Sub-scale model design methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluating the innumerable combinations of these variables in the laboratory to optimize an asphalt mixture is onerous. Computational models can supplement such laboratory-based optimization studies due to their capability of executing a broad range of parametric and probabilistic analyses. This study demonstrates the potential of using a physics engine to simulate the asphalt mixture compaction process. Physics engines were originally developed for animation and video games, however, with improvement in their accuracy, they are currently being used in many research areas. This study presents a computational model developed using an open source physics engine to virtually compact asphalt mixtures in a gyratory compactor. This model uses 3D laser-scanned representations of real aggregate particles and incorporates the viscous and cohesive nature of the asphalt mortar through customized subroutines. To demonstrate the feasibility of this model, the effect of the three key compaction parameters (i) angle of gyration, (ii) compaction pressure, and (iii) specimen height on the compaction characteristics were analyzed and compared with laboratory findings from various studies.

To reduce their size and associated maintenance and operation costs, they are sometimes installed above broad-crested weirs. To explore the effects of the installation location of the sluice gate and the sill height on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow passing through the sluice-gated weir, six laboratory models were tested. The 427 and 449 data points included both free- and submerged-flow conditions, respectively. Analytical relationships were developed for the contraction, head-loss, and Henry's (1950) discharge coefficients. Based on the maximization of the discharge and contraction coefficients and the minimization of the head-loss coefficient, results suggest that a gate should be installed at a distance of L/2 (where L is the sill length) from the upstream end of the weir crest, and the height of 1.25Hd (where Hd is the water depth as referenced from the weir sill elevation) is the optimal height for the weir. By conducting experiments and constructing correlations for determining the contraction and head-loss coefficients under free flow conditions, the average values of these coefficients for the laboratory models were obtained as 0.664 and 0.133, respectively. Applying the average contraction and head-loss coefficients to the developed relationship for estimating the free and submerged discharge coefficients resulted in an error of 4% and 6%, respectively. WinGate alpha 0.2 software was used to estimate the experimental free and submerged discharge coefficient of the gated weir with an average error of 5.4% and 12.7%, respectively. It was done without any consideration of the cross-section shape of the weir or the location of the gate on the weir sill.

The existing lumped parameter models (LPMs) for shear wall–frame dual systems exhibit some drawbacks. There is a discrepancy in their arrangement of springs. They are calibrated to match only two modal periods of the original multi-story or even high-rise building structure. The existing models also have limitations when confronted with the P-Δ effect. After a careful investigation, this paper developed new schemes of spring-stick assemblies that accurately reproduce the elastic stiffness matrix of a two-dimensional Euler–Bernoulli or Timoshenko beam–column element and cope with geometric and material nonlinearities. The developed assemblies, which are essentially lumped parameter substitutes for beam–column elements, can be used to build LPMs for moment frames and shear walls. For moment frames, the traditional fishbone model is converted into a LPM that not only reflects the beam-to-column stiffness ratio and strength ratio but also captures the P-Δ effect. Combining the LPM for shear wall with the lumped parameter fishbone model results in an improved LPM for wall–frame dual systems. Together with lumped floor masses, the improved LPM is able to accurately predict all the global vibration modes and nonlinear seismic responses of a dual system. The proposed LPM possesses distinct advantages when simplified macroscopic models are preferred for building structures.","2024-08-15","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:31:58","","109633","","","91","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Beam–column element; Dual system; Fishbone model; Lumped parameter model; Moment frame; Shear wall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In operation, the wheels of container cranes move on rails freely but are usually anchored when at rest. Therefore, the wheels could be lifted up and derailed due to seismic excitation. The boundary condition of a container crane has not been fully addressed in past research. It has mostly been simplified as pin supports without considering the possibilities of uplift and derailment of the crane legs. Hence, there is a need to conduct a study focusing on the effects of derailment and uplift on a container crane's seismic response. This paper investigates the seismic response of a container crane via a shake table testing of a 1/20 scale crane constructed according to the similitude law, with a simulation of the boundary condition of the scale crane as a pin and a friction boundary. A white noise test was conducted to determine the natural frequencies of the scale crane, then the seismic response of the container crane was determined via three input ground motions. The three input ground motions were designed by matching real earthquakes to the Korean design elastic response spectrum and scaling down for the shake table testing. Under these seismic excitations, the responses of the container crane were considered in terms of uplift, derailment, portal movement, and bending moments. The shake table testing shows that the maximum difference in the natural frequencies of the crane for the portal sway mode, between the friction boundary and pin support, was 2.1%. Due to the effects of derailment and uplift of the landside legs, the bending moments in the crane's seaside legs with a friction boundary were 109% higher than those with a pinned boundary. In addition, a residual deformation was observed in the portal frame after the vibration had stopped when the scale crane was assigned a friction boundary.","2021-09-01","2025-07-11 02:55:43","2025-07-11 08:28:34","","102811","","","114","","Applied Ocean Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acceleration; Bending moment; Boundary condition; Earthquake; Natural frequency; Response spectrum; Similitude law; Strain gauge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, shell structures, constrained by wall thickness, cannot undergo experiments through proportional downsizing. Existing similitude studies with retained wall thickness exhibit only minimal distortion, and accurate prediction of vibration responses is hindered by modal distribution disorder. To address these challenges, a method based on modified frequency response functions of natural frequencies and mode shapes is proposed. Scaling laws for natural frequencies and mode shapes of cylindrical shells with retained wall thickness are established. This method yields a maximum prediction error of 4.29 % for prototype natural frequencies, compared to 50.57 % for existing methods. Predicted prototype vibration acceleration responses correspond well with theoretical calculations in both frequency and amplitude, while existing methods fail entirely. The phenomenon of modal distribution disorder and the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating it are verified by modal experiments and response tests. Research reveals that the sensitivity of different modal frequencies to the wall thickness scaling factor varies, serving as the cause of modal distribution disorder. The modal distribution with the same circumferential wave number is unaffected by wall thickness. Modes above the bending frequency, with axial half-wavelength consistent with bending modes, are prone to disorder due to wall thickness distortion.

Employing the Realizable k-ε turbulence model and additional bubble plume mechanisms, the model was rigorously validated against well-documented experimental data, showing high levels of agreement across multiple metrics. Key environmental safety parameters—such as rise time and H2S surface gas concentration, indicative of toxic exposure risk to aquatic life and human health—were extracted for multiple release scenarios. To present generalized and easily accessible data, these parameters were nondimensionalized and incorporated into a nomograph, enabling environmental risk assessments to be conducted four orders of magnitude faster than with high-fidelity simulations. The study emphasizes the nomograph's utility in rapid, environmentally relevant risk assessment and emergency planning for mitigating the impact of sour gas spills.

While the isolators' performance has been the subject of several studies, certain vital limitations remain. Firstly, the optimal effectiveness of isolators with respect to the characteristics of the superstructure and underlying soil is unclear. Secondly, there is a notable lack of a prediction model assessing the isolators' efficacy before any detailed analysis. Lastly, the dearth of empirical evidence that testifies to the performance of isolators in real situations is palpable. This study was devoted to addressing these shortcomings. In order to meet this goal, a 2D numerical model of a building, soil medium, and under-foundation resilient layer (UFRL) was created. Extensive parametric analysis of the model demonstrated that the performance of UFRLs was significantly (up to 15 dB) affected by the features of the soil and building. The conditions in which UFRLs have optimal performance were identified. Based on the results obtained, a prediction model was proposed to estimate the efficacy of UFRLs. Afterward, a 3D numerical and physical simulation of a five-story building was developed to evaluate the performance of UFRLs and validate the proposed prediction model in practical scenarios.

Novel nuclear reactor designs, such as self-pressurized small modular integral reactors (SMiR), represent a new challenge regarding this issue since they are designed to work at conditions for which traditional tools and procedures may cause too large uncertainties. In addition, traditional fluid-to-fluid modeling techniques for CHF tests have been derived from experiments mainly performed at PWR conditions and therefore its use is doubtful at different conditions. In this work we make use of water and Freon (CCl2F2) experimental data points obtained at low mass flow condition and relatively low subcooling representing natural circulation CAREM-25 SMiR at nominal pressure and at 10 MPa. The test section consists of 19-rods in a hexagonal array mimicking 1/6 of CAREM-25 fuel bundle. Traditional fluid-to-fluid mass flux scaling rules (derived by Ahmad and Katto) are then used to quantify its performance by comparing water and Freon data tests performed at similar conditions in a dimensionless space. Such a space is defined by the subcooling number, the phase change number and the so-called mass flux number. As a result of this part of the study it is concluded that the use of Katto’s scaling rule for the mass flux produces an average error in estimating water data of around 10 %. In addition, the use of Ahmad’s scaling rule causes an average error of about 20 % when estimating water data. Due to these modest performances, a dedicated mass flux scaling rule was derived based on the dimensionless Weber and liquid Reynolds numbers. The new scaling rule succeeded in reducing the average difference between water and Freon test data to less than 3 %. The use of the proposed scaling rule allowed treating the Freon and water data as a single dataset, which in turn enlarged the experimental domain. The proposed mass flux scaling rule is thus recommended for fluid-to-fluid CHF tests at low mass flux conditions and reduced subcooling numbers.","2022-10-01","2025-07-11 02:55:44","2025-07-11 08:18:03","","111951","","","397","","Nuclear Engineering and Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Critical heat flux; Fluid-to-fluid scaling; Small modular integral Reactors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are a favorable option for dam rehabilitation and upstream level control. There are various geometries of labyrinth type weirs such as trapezoidal, triangular or piano key as well as different types of crest profiles. Geometric changes are directly related to hydraulic efficiency. The objective of this work was to analyze the hydraulic performance of a labyrinth type weir, by simulating several geometries of the apex and of the crest using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). For model validation, experimental studies reported in the literature were used. Tests were carried out with trapezoidal and circular apexes and four types of crest profiles: sharp-crest, half-round, quarter-round and Waterways Experiment Station (WES). The results revealed a determination coefficient of R2 = 0.984 between experimental and simulated data with CFD, which provides statistical agreement. Simulations showed that circular-apex weirs are more efficient than those with trapezoidal apex, because they have a higher discharge coefficient (4.7% higher). Of the four types of crest profiles analyzed, the half-round and the WES crest profiles had similar discharge coefficients and were generally greater than those of the sharp-crest and the quarter-round (5.26% y 8.5% higher) profiles. Nevertheless, to facilitate a practical construction process, it is recommended to use a half-round profile. For hydraulic heads with HT/P > 0.5 ratio, all profiles generated sub-atmospheric pressures on the side walls of the weir. However, when HT/P ≈ 0.8 ratio the half-round crest generated a higher negative pressure (−1500 Pa), while the sharp-crest profile managed to increase the pressure by 76% (−350 Pa), but with a greater area of negative pressure.

As a common unit operation and also green infrastructure, clarification basins are widely implemented to sequester PM as well as PM-partitioned chemicals and pathogens. Despite ubiquitous application for urban drainage, stormwater clarification basin design and optimization lacks robust and efficient design guidance and tools. Current basin design and regulation primarily adopt residence time (RT) as presumptive guidance. This study examines the accuracy and generalizability of RT and nondimensional groups of basin geometric and dynamic similarity (Hazen, Reynolds, Schmidt numbers) to scale clarification basin performance (measured as PM separation and total PM separation). Published data and 160,000 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of basin PM separation over a wide range of basin configurations, loading conditions, and PM granulometry (particle size distribution [PSD], density) are examined. Based on the CFD database, a novel implementation of machine learning (ML) models: decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and symbolic regression (SR) are developed and trained as surrogate models for basin PM separation predictions. Study results indicate that: (1) Models based solely on RT are not accurate or generalizable for basin PM separation, with significant differences between CFD and RT models primarily for RT < 200 hr, (2) RT models are agnostic to basin configurations and PM granulometrics and therefore do not reproduce total PM separation, (3) Trained ML models provide high predictive capability, with (R2) above 0.99 and prediction for total PM separation within ±15%. In particular, the SR model distilled from CFD simulations is entirely defined by only two compact algebraic equations (allowing use in a spreadsheet tool). The SR model has a physical basis and indicates PM separation is primarily a function of the Hazen number and basin horizontal and vertical aspect ratios, (4) With common presumptive guidance of 80% for PM separation, a Pareto frontier analysis indicates that the CFD-ML augmented SR model generates significant economic benefit for basin planning/design, and (5) CFD-ML models show that enlarging basin dimensions (increasing RT) to address impaired behavior can result in exponential cost increases, irrespective of land/infrastructure adjacency conflicts. CFD-ML applications can extend to intra-basin retrofits (permeable baffles) to upgrade impaired basins.","2022-02-01","2025-07-11 02:55:44","2025-07-11 08:21:03","","117965","","","209","","Water Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CFD; Computer aided design; Green water infrastructure; Machine learning; Retention; Water treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a shaking table test, this study investigated the dynamic response of the deposit slope with weak interlayer at the exit of the Zheduo Mountain Tunnel reinforced by pile-anchor structures. The acceleration field of the slope, peak value of the dynamic earth pressure of the pile, deformation of the pile, anchor cable tension and load-sharing ratio were considered. The findings demonstrate that as an earthquake intensifies, the slope soil behind a pile gradually becomes compressed; subsequently, tension cracks emerge at the back edge of the slope and expand significantly, eventually forming a penetrating sliding surface. Under various earthquake intensity levels, the acceleration amplification coefficient of the slope increases with the elevation. A weak interlayer can amplify the amplitude of the Fourier spectra, which results in a difference in the vibration between the deposit and bedrock and damage to the slope. When the acceleration exceeds 0.3g, the soil behind pile begins to squeeze it, and the peak value of the dynamic earth pressure first increases and then decreases along the elevation of the pile, reaching its maximum near the sliding surface. The load-sharing ratio of the pile-anchor structure steadily decreases as the peak acceleration of the seismic wave, tension of the anchor cable, and limiting effect of the anchor cable on the pile displacement increase. We suggest that the amplification effect of seismic acceleration should be considered in the seismic design of pile-anchor structures, with local reinforcement near the sliding surface of the pile, and the load-sharing ratio of the structure should be flexible.","2023-07-01","2025-07-11 02:55:44","2025-07-11 08:16:15","","107912","","","170","","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acceleration amplification; Deposit slope; Dynamic earth pressure; Load-sharing ratio; Pile-anchor structure; Shaking table test; Weak interlayer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are generally built using strong hypotheses (e.g. fully developed flow and no relative motion between particles) that affect their accuracy. We study the effect of these hypotheses on particle dynamics using the sedimentation of a pair of particles. We develop new induced drag, lift and torque models for pairs of particles based on an artificial neural network (ANN) regression. The fluid force model covers a range of Reynolds numbers of 0.1 to 100 and particle centroid distance of up to 9 particle diameters. The ANN model uses 3475 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results as the training data set. Using this fluid force model, we develop a reduced-order model (ROM), which includes the virtual mass force, the Meshchersky force, the history force, the lubrication force, and the Magnus force. Using the results of a resolved computational fluid dynamics coupled with a discrete element method (CFD-DEM) model as a reference, we analyze the discrepancies between the ROM and CFD-DEM results for a series of sedimentation cases that cover particle Archimedes number from 20 to 2930 and particle to fluid density ratio of 1.5 to 1000. The errors primarily stem from particle history interactions that are not accounted for by the fully developed flow hypothesis. The importance of this effect on the dynamic of two particles is isolated and it is shown that it is more pronounced in cases with a lower particle-to-fluid density ratio (such as solid–liquid cases). This work underscores the need for more research on these effects to increase the precision of solid–fluid force models for small particle-to-fluid density ratios (1.5).","2024-08-01","2025-07-11 02:55:44","2025-07-11 08:15:47","","104882","","","178","","International Journal of Multiphase Flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computational fluid dynamics with the discrete element method (CFD-DEM); Immersed boundary; Navier–Stokes incompressible flow; Pair-wise particle interaction; Reduced order modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of this study can be beneficial in situations where high flow rates need to be accommodated, particularly in flood season, and minimize the risk of overflow, reducing the number of gates for a particular discharge; thereby, the supporting infrastructure's effective cost will minimize. Furthermore, it can help to mitigate erosion and maintain the stability of downstream environments.","2024-04-01","2025-07-11 02:55:44","2025-07-11 08:19:31","","102556","","","96","","Flow Measurement and Instrumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Discharge; Discharge coefficient; Flow measurement; Labyrinth gate; Open channel; Sluice gate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, a three-dimensional transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) fire model for small curvature radius urban traffic link tunnel (UTLT)-like tunnel was established to understand the scope and extent of curvature effect on the fire-induced smoke under emergency state. The results show that, in the curved tunnel area, small curvature radius or large critical ventilation velocity results in stronger centrifugal force of the fire smoke, readily destabilizing the fire smoke downstream of the fire source. Compared with large radius of curvature and straight tunnels, due to the greater resistance of curved walls in small curvature radius tunnel, the length of smoke back-layering is longer. Simultaneously, the temperature of the high-temperature smoke on the outer wall of the ceiling cross section is higher than the inner wall. Prediction mathematical models for the maximum temperature and longitudinal temperature profiles were further developed by taking the curvature and ventilation velocity effect, which is basically consistent with experimental and simulated results.","2022-09-01","2025-07-11 02:55:44","2025-07-11 08:18:54","","104599","","","127","","Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ceiling temperature; Fire simulation; Longitudinal temperature distribution; Small curvature radius; Temperature attenuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments were conducted on three different drop heights, considering eight different grid drop-type dissipators with certain grids dimensions. Results demonstrate that assembling this type of dissipator at the edge of a vertical drop increases the rate of energy dissipation up to about 70%, compared to a plain vertical drop. Owing to the increase in flow momentum and the falling jets’ collision with bottom of the downstream channel, for a given flow discharge, while the porosity of the grid drop-type dissipator is increased, the wetted length of the dissipator and the energy dissipation decrease; however, the length and depth of the pool at the drop base increase. The relative length of the pool is significantly affected by air entrainment, caused by the spaces between the separated falling jets. By increasing flow discharge, pressure fluctuations decrease and trend of the variation of average pressure becomes smoother.

In the present study, an analysis method using dimensionless parameters is proposed for predicting the thermal stratification, and the Box-Behnken design method is employed to determine the simulation cases of inﬂuencing factors for thermal stratification. The thermal performance in IJV cooling room is investigated by computational fluid dynamics (ANSYS Fluent), and the effects of supply air parameters, inlet area (S*) and height (h*) on thermal stratification are discussed, respectively. A further supply air parameter is represented by the thermal length scale (Lm), which is applied to evaluate the combined effect of inertial force and thermal buoyancy on supply airflow. The results show that the driving force on supply airflow changes from buoyancy dominated to inertial dominated with increasing Lm, leading to the thermal stratification profiles changing from thermal stratification to uniform distribution. For small Lm, the thermal stratification profiles are similar for different inlet areas, while the dimensionless air temperature decreases with increasing inlet area. However, the larger inlet area promotes a more uniform temperature distribution for large Lm. In addition, the thermal stratiﬁcation profiles are similar regardless of the inlet height for both small and large Lm conditions, indicating that the dimensionless air temperature is a weak function of inlet height. Finally, multiple regression models related to Lm, S* and h* are developed for predicting the thermal stratification, which can provide a reference basis for the determination of temperature distribution in IJV cooling rooms.","2021-12-01","2025-07-11 02:55:45","2025-07-11 08:19:42","","108311","","","206","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CFD; Impinging jet ventilation; Multiple regression analysis; Prediction model; Thermal stratification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, porous media were employed to simulate various components, including the core simulator, heat exchanger, pump, and decay heat removal systems. Initially, a steady-state calculation was performed, involving a comprehensive series of sensitivity analyses on mesh parameters, wall properties, and turbulent models. Furthermore, three distinct mass flow rates, namely 100%, 50%, and 25%, were investigated. Subsequently, transient simulations were carried out, considering different time step sizes and geometry scales. Notably, forced and natural circulations were examined, encompassing scenarios that involved the loss of mass flow and circulation height. The obtained results demonstrated the presence of thermal stratification within the cold pool (CP) for both the 2D and 3D models in steady-state and transient simulations. However, the temperature distribution within the hot pool (HP) exhibited significant disparities between the 2D and 3D models. Meanwhile, the Richardson number difference between two models indicated that the 2D model is capable, but difficult to accurately represent the thermal stratification of the 3D model. One prominent reason was that the relative concentration of hot lead-bismuth eutectic within the HP was relatively lower in the 2D model compared to that in the CP, which deviated from the proportions observed in the 3D model.","2024-04-01","2025-07-11 02:55:45","2025-07-11 08:27:23","","105084","","","169","","Progress in Nuclear Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CLEAR-S facility; Dimensional effect; Porous media; Thermal stratification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By applying a scaling, the bidirectional interactions between the test object and the remaining system can be considered in a scaled way. It is currently unclear how mass-based effects can be considered in the scaling model to reflect the behavior of unscaled systems. In this paper, the influence of mass-based effects on the adaptation of rotational quantities between interconnected systems is analyzed and compensated by virtual inertias to allow scaled component tests considering the remaining system. Using the example of a torque limiting clutch from a geared rotary actuator out of an aircraft, the influences of the rotational inertia of the drive shaft on the scaling are analyzed in a simulation study. The simulation shows an influence of the rotational inertia on the scaling and the system behavior if these effects are not considered in the scaling. The determining influence is taken into account in the scaling laws using adapted scaling laws by the integration of virtual inertia within the scaling. The results show that virtual inertia can be added to the scaling model to reflect mass-based effects in behavior.

This study investigated the seismic performance of a novel prefabricated box culvert with split components (PBC-SC) to be constructed in the class Ⅱ site. A 1:10 test model fully considering all connection details was prepared, and shaking table tests were conducted using El Centro seismic waves with peak accelerations ranging from 0.1 g to 0.3 g. The full-scale numerical simulation of the soil-structure model of PBC-SC was prefabricated with ABAQUS to truly account for soil-structure interaction effect.

Even under the excitation peak acceleration of 0.3 g El Centro seismic wave, the measured acceleration and Fourier spectrum of each segment had only a small difference, thus usage of PBC-SC as a global structure could offer relatively continuous deformability and good seismic performance. To decompose the box culvert into simple assembled components, the connection techniques such as cylindrical pin connection, tongue-and-groove connection and mortise-tenon connection were adopted to ensure the seismic performance of PBC-SC.

The geometric intricacies of these structures not only influence their mechanical behavior but also provide a vast design space for exploring new frontiers in structural development. This study investigated a unique form of curved thin-walled structure, namely the corrugated annular conical shell, which exhibits diverse degrees of cylindrical orthotropy across various corrugation patterns. An analytical model was formulated based on the minimum total potential energy principle and first-order shear deformable shell theory to predict the non-monotonous force-deflection relationships and non-uniform stress distributions in corrugated conical shells when axially loaded under compression. Within this novel framework, the local undulation shape, corrugation pitch, and amplitude emerged as influential determinants of the responses of corrugated shells, intrinsically intertwined with the polar and shear orthotropy ratios. The accuracy of our analytical model was verified by comparing its results to those obtained using the finite element method and experimental measurements. A machine learning method was employed to classify the stability behaviors of corrugated annular conical shells and derive comprehensive design maps for the first time. Corrugated annular conical shells hold enticing potential for applications as adaptive spring units or building blocks for more sophisticated architectural metamaterials.","2024-01-15","2025-07-11 02:55:45","2025-07-11 08:29:09","","108724","","","262","","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Belleville spring; Bistable; Conical shell; Corrugation; Large deformation; Negative stiffness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context of existing research, which predominantly concentrates on single spur dikes, this study stands out by specifically delving into the temporal changes in scour depth near initial spur dike in multiple spur dikes. Varied spacings, lengths and flow velocities are considered in this exploration. After comprehensive literature analysis, it could be asserted that use of multiple spur dikes consistently results in shallower equilibrium scour depths compared to a single spur dike. The study introduces a predictive model by examining the impact of different influencing factors, including spacing, length, and flow velocity, on scour depth. The proposed equation establishes a robust correlation between the observed and estimated scour depth values. The study explores the temporal changes in scour depth, revealing that the time needed to arrive at equilibrium scour depth is drastically reduced when employing multiple spur dikes. Furthermore, the investigation highlights that in multiple spurs in series, the maximum equilibrium scour is lower compared to that in single spur dikes. The model, encompassing various parameters such as flow velocity, spacing, length, and time, demonstrates high predictive accuracy. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamic behaviour of scour at multiple spur dikes and offers a predictive tool for effective riverbank protection and ecosystem management.

We measured and obtained the seismic data with various attributes, such as the characteristic image of different probability horizontal seismic action, acceleration and dynamic soil pressure. By analyzing the time-domain characteristics of multi-attribute data such as deformation characteristics and acceleration, we revealed the instability mode of the slope model and the regional response characteristics of particle spatial position. Based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Statistical Probability Sperm Matrix (SPSM), we proposed the damage level correlation between the spectral characteristics of acceleration and dynamic soil pressure. We obtained the relationship between the variation of the frequency and specific period between acceleration and dynamic soil pressure at different seismic stages through in-depth study, and then calculated the regional differences of spectrum displacement (Sd) by using Seism Signal. In the frequency domain of acceleration and dynamic soil pressure signals, the predominant frequencies were mostly concentrated in 0.5–8 Hz. Under high seismic acceleration, the amplitude frequency of acceleration spectrum of conventional pile and EPS pile was both 1.51 Hz, and the dominant frequency of dynamic soil pressure was significantly different. There was a positive correlation between seismic acceleration and dynamic soil pressure. The shift of frequency profile and main frequency band of EPS pile was mainly caused by the propagation stage after the acceleration main shock. Under high seismic acceleration, the deformation of EPS pile and conventional pile occurred to some extent. EPS plate was used as the damping layer to buffer and dissipated the deformation of the slope under earthquake, and its effect was linked to the seismic data attributes. The spectral displacement of EPS pile was reduced as a whole was higher than that of conventional pile. The slip surface of pile body was sensitive to earthquake, and it was easy to become the weak seismic link of the EPS pile. These results are helpful for us to provide a theoretical basis for improving the reliability optimization design of dynamic parameters of the pile structure.","2022-03-01","2025-07-11 02:55:45","2025-07-11 08:29:07","","107140","","","154","","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acceleration response; Dynamic soil pressure response; Seismic action; Shaking table test; Slope engineering; Soil-pile system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tested 1/20 scale container crane was initially designed based on the similitude laws with scaling factors proportional to the sectional properties and dynamic characteristics of a commonly used full-scale crane. To determine experimental natural frequencies of the tested crane, a white noise test was conducted on the shake table. Then, three different ground motions, including Manjil Iran Abbar, Nahanni Canada, and Mineral Virginia, were individually applied in a trolley-boom direction to the crane placed on the shake table to secure its seismic responses, especially for derailment, uplift and drift. A finite element model of the tested crane was also created using multi-frame elements available in commercially used FEA software and simulated to replicate the testing results. Key findings revealed that the effect of the boundary conditions did not significantly affect the mode shapes and frequencies of the tested crane, but the drifts of the crane with the friction boundary condition resulting from each of the ground motions changed substantially as compared to those from the crane with the pin boundary condition. The derailment displacement at the landside legs of the tested crane was also found to be 12.5 mm for the Manjil Iran and Nahanni Canada earthquakes and 11.5 mm for the Mineral Virginia earthquake.

Here, we have exclusively limited the complex FIV studies to vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and galloping. Primarily, the various computational methods adopted in the numerical modelling of FIV, particularly Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modelling, direct numerical simulation (DNS) etc. are elucidated in detail while other approaches like detached eddy simulation (DES) and large eddy simulation (LES) are briefly discussed, followed by a concise review of experimental studies on this phenomenon.

By combining simulation results with experimental results, a novel ultrasonic atomized dust removal system was developed. The droplet resisting the airstream in the front of the filter could significantly improve the dust removal efficiency by increasing the thickness of filter from 8 cm to 16 cm and filling rate from 6.49% to 18.91% at low dust concentration as 0.7 g/m3.

Subsequently, a shaking table experiment was carried out to investigate the dynamic characteristics and seismic responses of a three-stage slope supported by an anchoring lattice beam.

However, there has been limited research on the fire performance similarity of cross-laminated timber (CLT) components. In this study, the scaling relationships of fire resistances of CLT floors, including the similarity of out-of-plane bending performance and the similarity of fire resistance, were investigated. To assess compliance with static similarity criteria, out-of-plane bending tests were conducted on CLT floors with varying scales. Based on the similarity analysis of static loading test results, the influence of size effect on out-of-plane load-carrying capacity was analysed. Afterwards, the basic requirements for the similarity of fire resistance were studied, and the thermomechanical similarity criteria with size effect of CLT floors were derived. Fire tests designed by the proposed thermomechanical similarity criteria were performed on CLT floors with different scales. A numerical approach, including mechanical improved models with size effect and similar thermomechanical models, was developed to determine the fire response of CLT scale components and verify the thermomechanical similarity criteria.

Propane (R290) not only does not damage the ozone layer and has a negligible greenhouse effect, but also its charge is about 20–50% of that of hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, and the releasable charge is lower. In the previous study, a refrigerant pump-down method was proposed to control the R290 releasable charge of split-type household air conditioners (STHACs) under off-mode below the critical releasable charge (CRC) to prevent fires. CRC varies with leakage conditions, such as leak hole sizes, the distance between the installation height of the indoor unit (IDU) and the ignition source (dispersion distance), and the construction of IDU, etc. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to predict the CRCs for STHACs with different capacities and constructions under various leak conditions. The model is verified to have a deviation within 10% for the vast majority of data-points by ignition experiment and CFD model. For safety, the CRC prediction formula is optimized to under-predict CRCs properly, therefore, CRCs for various STHACs and leak conditions are determined to prevent the formation of flammable mixtures even directly under IDU, and the indoor air quality will also be improved.

Additionally, Charpy impact specimens were taken from three specific positions on the wheel rims and subjected to standard Charpy impact testing. The resulting Charpy impact energy (CVN) were matched with the fracture toughness measured by ISIT (KIc,IT) at the same positions. There was a clear linear correlation between CVN and the square of KIc,IT, which was consistent with the established relationship between both properties as determined by conventional Charpy impact and compact tension tests. Therefore, we expanded the ISIT method to study the impact of cooling rates on the variation of yield strength and Charpy impact energy across the wheel rim. To accomplish this, we designated additional testing points on the wheel rim using the ISIT method. The investigation found trade-offs between strength and impact toughness of wheel steels under different cooling rates.

However, riffle- pool sequences also have significant width undulations that are vital to riffle-pool sequences morphodynamics, yet relatively few studies exist on the effect of such undulations on hyporheic exchanges. Thus, in this study based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, we investigate the effect of bed and width undulations on hyporheic zone characteristics for various ratio of width amplitude to bed amplitude. The variation of hyporheic exchange characteristics (i.e. hyporheic exchange flux and residence time) for different riffle-pool designs were also assessed by creating prescribed topography of synthetic river valleys. The results showed that due to pressure variation along width undulations, the upwelling and downwelling patterns can also be observed for only width undulations in rivers, in the absence of bed undulations, and as width undulation amplitude decreases, the normalized hyporheic exchanges (Q*HZ) increase and normalized median residence time (RT*) decreases. Also, simultaneous channel bed and width undulations result in higher Q*HZ especially when a pool is located in an expansion (aka “oversized” cross-section) and a riffle in a constriction (“nozzle”). Our results suggest that river restoration project that artificially construct wide pools and constricted riffles will achieve maximum Q*HZ and RT*, though they will not be geomorphically self-sustainable.","2021-03-01","2025-07-11 02:56:02","2025-07-11 08:28:07","","103857","","","149","","Advances in Water Resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bed undulation; Hyporheic exchanges; Residence time; Width undulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To clarify the law of centrifugal granulation of molten slag, the effects of the structure parameters of the rotating cup, the way the slag tube and the rotating cup are matched, and the eccentricity on characteristics of molten slag are investigated in the paper. In the present work, an unsteady, three dimensional, and two-phase model is established to analyze the influence of the above factors on the particle size distribution, average particle size, and maximum and minimum particle size of the granulated slags. As a result, in the range of 0–45°, the increase of the inclination of the inner wall surface of the rotating cup can strengthen the granulation effect. To ensure the granulation effect, the ratio of the diameter of the slag tube to the rotating cup should not exceed 0.44, and the installation height of the slag tube should be as close as possible to the granulator. Moreover, to make the particle size uniform after granulation, the slag eccentricity is kept within 5%. Finally, the dimensionless correlation of the diameter of droplets was obtained to guide industrial practice to control the particle size of the granulated slag particles in the paper.","2021-07-05","2025-07-11 02:56:03","2025-07-11 08:21:15","","117026","","","193","","Applied Thermal Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Granulation characteristics; Granulator structure; Molten slag; Numerical Simulation; Waste heat recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CFD modelling is performed using an open-source three-phase numerical model (REEF3D), which solves Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations with k-ω turbulence closure. The CFD model is first validated using the experiments and then used for further investigation. The Exner equation was used to compute alterations in bed elevation, while the Level-Set method recorded the free surface and bed topography in a realistic manner. The experimental findings demonstrate that the initial phase of scour development is more rapid under combined wave-current flow, but the equilibrium scour depth is higher in current-only conditions. The increase in Keulegan Carpenter (KC) number increases the scour depth at vertical-wall abutments for a specific relative flow velocity (Ucw). In contrast, a mild increase in vertical-wall abutment scour depth is observed with an increase in Ucw.

The context is the cultivation of microalgae at high cell concentrations. In fact, it necessitates the reduction of the bioreactor thickness to allow light penetration through the whole culture. In the same time, the medium becomes shear-thinning for biomass concentrations higher than 30 g L−1. A 2 g L−1 carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and a 1 g L−1 Xanthan Gum (XG) aqueous solutions are studied to mimic the behavior of 42 g L−1 Chlorella vulgaris cultures. Besides, a comparison with water, representing the Newtonian liquid phase at low culture concentrations, is proposed. The bubble equivalent diameter is varied between 1.34 and 3.36 mm using different capillary sizes to generate the bubbles. Results show the complex and coupled effects of confinement and shear-thinning behavior of the liquid phase on bubbles terminal velocity, shape and trajectory. In fact, compared to the case of an infinite liquid medium, confinement increases wall friction on the bubbles, while reduces the liquid phase apparent viscosity in its neighborhood due to increased shear rate. This is why, depending on the bubble size, the bubble terminal velocity in shear-thinning fluids can be higher or lower than in unconfined conditions. For bubbles rising in shear-thinning fluids, contrary to water, it is observed that confinement induces a transition from spherical shape to ellipsoidal shape that occurs sooner in terms of bubbles diameter or Eo number. A correlation for the bubble drag coefficient in confined conditions in presence of shear-thinning fluids is also proposed for confinement ratios db/e between 0.34 and 0.84.","2021-03-01","2025-07-11 02:56:03","2025-07-11 08:15:24","","218-230","","","167","","Chemical Engineering Research and Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Drag coefficient; Non-Newtonian liquid; Single bubble terminal velocity; Thin-gap bubble column","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their increasing complexity requires the development of numerical tools, which need to be validated experimentally through adequate physical models. New challenges hence arise, since the subsystems integrated in the structure generally follow different scaling laws and may need relatively large physical models to achieve a reliable similitude between the full-scale structure and its physical model counterpart. The latter issue can be critical, because indoor tests in wave tanks and basins constrain the scale factors to the size of the available facilities. Open-sea experiments, albeit challenging because of the uncontrolled environmental conditions, could be a valid complement to the traditional indoor tests.

This paper presents a novel flow model for curve-constricted geometries that is applicable over a wide range of flow regimes including localized cavitation. Using a dimensionless form, the proposed model characterizes the constriction flow velocity as the function of the constriction shape, the pressure difference, and a properly defined cavitation indicator. The functional relationships between these dimensionless parameters are developed based on CFD simulations. The flow model is validated by the means of several experiments conducted on a custom test apparatus. The model presented in this paper can be incorporated in the lumped parameter simulation tools widely used for modelling gear pumps, improving their accuracy in predicting the internal leakages.

The hypervelocity impact cratering behaviors indicate that the cratering deformation of AZ31B Mg alloy is mainly affected by the inertia and strength of the target material. The crater prediction equation of AZ31B Mg alloy target under impact velocity of 5 km s−1 is given. The 2017Al projectile completely melts in the Mg alloy target plate at the impact velocities of 3.8 km s−1 and 4.4 km s−1, and the microstructural evolution around the crater is: dynamic recrystallization zone, high-density twinning zone, low-density twinning zone, and Mg alloy matrix. It is found that the dynamic recrystallization, twinning and cracking are the main deformation behaviors for the AZ31B Mg alloy to absorb the shock wave energy and release the stress generated by the hypervelocity impact. The main plastic deformation mechanisms of the Mg alloy target during hypervelocity impact are twinning and dislocation slip. Microstructure analysis shows the interactions of twins-twins, dislocations-dislocations, and twins-dislocations determine the strain hardening during the hypervelocity impact process, which eventually contributes the dynamic mechanical properties.

Therefore, achieving optimal efficiency in the screen performance becomes essential for improved downstream processing. Several techniques such as physical modelling, empirical modelling, mathematical modelling and the discrete element method (DEM) have been adopted by scientists and engineers to study granular flow on vibrating screens. However, advancement in the current state-of-the-art modelling of particle screening requires a mechanistic understanding of their motion along the screen. This necessitates the need to fully quantify the granular rheology determined by the depth of the particle bed along the screen, the solid concentration, and the average velocity of the granular avalanche on the screen. In this study, the concept of granular rheology is applied to study granular media on vibrating screens. This approach overcomes the extreme dependency on machine-specific empirical models for vibrating screens. The kinematic outputs from DEM simulations are used to formulate a visco-plastic model of the granular rheology along an inclined vibratory screen. This mechanistic screening model includes a description of the rheology of granular flow on a vibrating screen. The model captures the flow transition from a quasi-static phase to a dense-flow regime. The quasi-static regime transition occurs at the inertial I value of 0.018, the dense-like regime to a turbulence or gas-like regime at 0.018 < I < 0.5. The inertial regime is observed to occur beyond the dense-flow regime.

By exploring statistically representative sets of random inclusions using linear elastic fracture mechanics expressions, trends of the particle arrangement effect on the stress intensity factor are observed. We find that ordered, random, and clumped inclusion arrangements show an increasing effect on toughness, in that order. These results are verified using finite element analysis. To quantify the observed trend in material behavior with the spatial order of inclusions we consider two metrics of order: the bond-orientational order parameter, Q, and the translational order parameter, T. Finite element models of particle composites with increasing degrees of order reveal that the increasing effect on toughness can be captured and that T is more closely correlated to the effect on the stress intensity factor. We also find that the correlation between the stress intensity factor and particle arrangement is sensitive to the nearest-neighbor distance in Q, revealing that a quantifier approaching a global measure of order is more representative depending on the inclusion volume fraction. The results of this work can improve our understanding of how the stress intensity factor in particle composites explicitly varies with inclusion arrangement.

Thus, a dynamic scaling design strategy for discontinuous bolted rotor systems is proposed in this paper. An improved continuous modeling method considering rods deformation based on equivalent material layer (EML) is introduced to reflect the weakening effect of the rotor stiffness with bolted structure, and the parameter mapping relationships between the continuous and the discontinuous structure are constructed. The scaling factors of each element of the rotor system are derived by the similarity theory. Through this approach, a discontinuous rotor system can be scaled, demonstrating a high level of consistency with the prototype in terms of natural frequencies, critical speeds as well as frequency response. In addition, modal experiments under different preloads and dynamic acceleration experiment are carried out to verify of the proposed modeling method for discontinuous rotor structures. The testing and simulation results prove that the introduced equivalent material layer reflects the contact effect of prototype accurately. Compared with the experimental results, the maximum deviation of the first two natural frequencies is 4.06%, and the maximum deviation of the critical speeds is 1.36%, demonstrating the potential of small size, low-cost scaled models for predicting the complex dynamic characteristics of the prototype rotor system.

Seven kinds of input criteria (Π1 ∼ Π7) are obtained, relevant to the fluid flow, pressure drop, flow resistance in a porous medium, activity loss, diffusion mass transfer, convective mass transfer and ohmic loss in PEMFC respectively. Dimensionless voltage and dimensionless current density are defined as two output criteria. Numerical verifications show that if the seven criteria keep their individual values with their components vary in a wide range, the dimensionless polarization curves keep the same with a deviation about 1%, showing the validity and feasibility of the present analysis. From the effect on the dimensionless polarization curve, sensibility analysis shows that the seven criteria can be divided into three categories: strong (Π4 and Π7, -94.9% ∼ +349.2%), mild to minor (Π5 and Π6, -4.5% ∼ +5.0%), and negligible (Π1, Π2 and Π3, -1.2% ∼ +1.1%).

The problem is solved by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using the Gibbs sampler. In this paper it is shown how to obtain the conditional PDFs for each one of the parameters, which define two typical correlations that appear in thermal–hydraulic problems, i) the heat transfer in the walls of a pipe and ii) the penetration length of steam discharged in a subcooled pool. The equations for the conditional probabilities of each one of the parameters are deduced and then used to build the Gibbs sampler which is then programmed in R. The PDFs are obtained for each one of the parameters and from these the maximum a posteriori of each one of the parameters is obtained. The new correlations obtained in this way are compared with the experimental data and show satisfactory performance for the case of the penetration of steam in a subcooled pool. Also, we study two cases one with a small number of experimental data and another one with a large number, it is observed that if the number of parameters is small the Markov chain converges fast to the region of high probability of the parameters for both cases with a small number of data and with large number of data, but if the number of parameters increases then the convergence for the case with small number of data becomes poor, however the convergence continuous being very fast for the case with large number of experimental data.","2024-04-01","2025-07-11 02:56:04","2025-07-11 08:28:22","","110318","","","198","","Annals of Nuclear Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian calibration; Gibbs sampler application to thermal hydraulic problems; Inverse methods; MCMC methods; Penetration of discharged steam in subcooled pools; Thermal–hydraulic correlations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbubble destabilization, driven by phase separation and improper brine-oil ratios, is a critical issue in EOR. The novelty of this research lies in the use of Acacia concinna, a natural, non-ionic surfactant, to enhance microbubble stability sustainably. The study systematically investigates foamability, drainage kinetics, surface tension, rheology, and bubble size distribution to assess microbubble stability. The results showed that increasing surfactant concentration and brine-oil ratio significantly impacted foam stability and bubble size distribution, with optimal stability conditions observed at 2 wt% surfactant concentration (53.6 min), 5000 ppm brine concentration (47.6 min), a brine-oil ratio of 1:2 (52.4 min), and a CO2 gas flow rate of 1 lpm. Key findings also indicate that increasing NaCl concentration from 5000 to 20,000 ppm caused an increase in microbubble diameter, while higher gas flow rates reduced bubble size. The work introduces new empirical correlations for predicting bubble size distribution based on column diameter, surfactant and brine concentrations, viscosity, density, and gas superficial velocity. These correlations provide a more accurate means of optimizing EOR processes, improving oil recovery efficiency while enhancing CO2 sequestration, contributing to both energy production and environmental sustainability.","2024-11-15","2025-07-11 02:56:04","2025-07-11 08:17:32","","156595","","","500","","Chemical Engineering Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acacia concinna; Bubble size distribution; CO microbubbles; Enhanced oil recovery; Foam stability; Rheology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, solar radiation measurements are available in few meteorological stations, so models are used to estimate global solar radiation from other climate variables. This paper presents a compilation of 165 global solar radiation models that is representative of the progress over the last 100 years. The models were classified according to the type of variables used and a large majority of dimensionally non-homogeneous equations were identified. Furthermore, it was observed that comparisons between various models studied in different regions over recent decades were occasionally contradictory, so that no single existing model seems to have definitively outperformed the others. In this context, homogeneity analysis provides a procedure to improve the quality of models by reducing the presence of variables implicit in numerical coefficients, which deserves to be valued as a methodological tool. In addition, a previously introduced temperature-based homogeneous model was updated using recent experimental data and revising the functional form of the local geographic factor dependent on elevation and distance to the sea. Using site-calibrated coefficients, the modified model provides accurate results at 22 meteorological stations in northern Spain, located over a distance of about 1000 km. Using a general equation, acceptable predictions are obtained for the 21 stations with the highest climatic similarity.","2022-03-01","2025-07-11 02:56:04","2025-07-11 08:29:42","","111856","","","155","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dimensional homogeneity; Global solar radiation; Homogeneous temperature-based model; Local geographic factor; Models; Northern Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine the discharge under a gate, the discharge coefficient (Cd) must be quantified. This study investigates the effect of sill shape under a vertical sluice gate on Cd. The study also includes the influence of height. The investigated shapes are comprised of polyhedral and non-polyhedral sills. Multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR) is applied to predict Cd values and the results show that circular sills under the gate can increase Cd by 23–31%. A circular sill with a 3 cm diameter has the highest Cd and trapezoidal sills have the lowest Cd. On the other hand, semicircular sills have moderate values of Cd. The most influential parameters affecting Cd are H1/p and Z/G where H1 is the upstream head over the sill crest, p is the sill wetted perimeter, Z is the height of sill, and G is the gate opening. Using dimensionless parameters and regression analysis, an equation for predicting Cd in free flow conditions with and without a sill is presented. The equation agrees with previously published results and can be implemented for predicting Cd in sluice gates with and without sills to within 6% accuracy.","2021-06-01","2025-07-11 02:56:04","2025-07-11 08:30:33","","125728","","","597","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Discharge coefficient; Regression; Sill; Sluice gate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fractures may have highly heterogeneous properties compared to the surrounding rock matrix, significantly affecting fluid flow, and at the same time hydraulic apertures that are much smaller than any other characteristic sizes in the domain. Generally, flow simulators face difficulties with counter-current flow, generated by gravity and pressure gradients, which hinders the convergence of non-linear solvers (Newton). In this work, we model the fracture geometry with a mixed-dimensional discrete fracture network, thus lightening the computational burden associated to an equi-dimensional representation. We address the issue of counter-current flows with appropriate spatial discretization of the advective fluid fluxes, with the aim of improving the convergence speed of the non-linear solver. In particular, the extension of the hybrid upwinding to the mixed-dimensional framework, with the use of a phase potential upstreaming at the interfaces of subdomains. We test the method across several cases with different flow regimes and fracture network geometries. Results show robustness of the chosen discretization and a consistent improvements, in terms of Newton iterations, compared to using phase potential upstreaming everywhere.","2024-12-01","2025-07-11 02:56:04","2025-07-11 08:15:42","","117437","","","432","","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Finite volume; Fractured porous media; Hybrid upwind; Mixed-dimensional; Two-phase flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compare three common strategies to measure porosity: the Archimedes, micrograph-based, and micro-computed tomography approaches. We find that while these methods work equally well at low void fraction, their predictions diverge at higher void fractions (> 5 %). We find that the disparity comes since the Archimedes method measures the total amount of solid in the sample, while micrograph-based approach neglects loose powder trapped inside the samples that can be removed during the preparation process. We conclude that these two methods make use of divergent definitions of porosity. While the Archimedes method measures a “total porosity” defined by the total volume fraction of void in the material, the micrograph method measures an “effective porosity” that only accounts for the continuous material. On the other hand, the resolution of micro-computed tomography is limited by voxel size, leading to ambiguity of trapped powder being identified as solid or void. Consequently, the number density of defects from micro-computed tomography are noticeably smaller than that from micrograph-based approach. A geometric model for porosity prediction is implemented and used to evaluate different models for melt pool geometry. Our numerical predictions of melt pool profiles are surprisingly insensitive to our choice of heat source models. Finally, an analytical geometric model is developed for fast estimation of total and effective porosities and shows good agreement with both numerical simulations and experimental measurement.","2022-02-01","2025-07-11 02:56:04","2025-07-11 08:29:45","","117426","","","300","","Journal of Materials Processing Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Archimedes; Finite element modeling; Lack-of-fusion porosity; Laser powder bed fusion; Micro-computed tomography; Micrographs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This criterion is based on the slip ratio between the dispersed and continuous phases. For this, the droplet size distribution was measured at the ESP outlet and the slip ratio was estimated based on the centrifugal buoyancy-induced flow. A new model was proposed to determine the Sauter mean diameter for different systems of the water-in-oil emulsion flows within the ESP based on operational conditions, which presents good agreement with the experimental data (12.6% of error).

This experimental setup's design is based on a non-dimensional and similarity analysis with a real device (Electric Submersible Pump Skid or ESP Skid) in operation at an offshore oilfield in Brazil. The experiments were performed in 5°, 15°, 30° 45° and 60° slopes, horizontally. Flow patterns in the annulus were observed and analyzed. Also, vortices were observed in the intake region. The gas-liquid separation tests enabled the association of the measured separation efficiency with mixture velocities and, consequently, with dimensionless parameters (Froude number) and no-slip void fraction. As observed in the literature, the separation decreases as the mixture velocity increases. The results were qualitatively correlated with literature models, but with high quantitative discrepancies, mainly due to the disregard for radial slip in the models.
