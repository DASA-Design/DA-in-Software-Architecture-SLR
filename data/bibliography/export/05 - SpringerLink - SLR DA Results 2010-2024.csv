It is a survey paper that takes a different look at problems involving latency, bandwidth, cache-miss ratios, and the efficiency of parallel numerical algorithms. The Pi Theorem is the fundamental tool of dimensional analysis, and it applies to problems in computer performance analysis just as well as it does to problems in other sciences. Applying it requires the definition of a system of measurement appropriate for computer performance analysis with a consistent set of units and dimensions. Then a straightforward recipe for each specific problem reduces the number of independent variables to a smaller number of dimensionless parameters. Two machines with the same values of these parameters are self-similar and behave the same way. Self-similarity relationships emphasize how machines are the same rather than how they are different. The Pi Theorem is simple to state and simple to prove, using purely algebraic methods, but the results that follow from it are often surprising and not simple at all. The results are often unexpected but they almost always reveal something new about the problem at hand.","2014-02-01","2023-03-04 21:11:31","2025-07-09 03:54:25","2023-03-04 21:11:31","45–71","","1","29","","Comput.

The model was developed based on a 12-month extensive field measurement at Sg. Bernam. This study established the governing factors and derived dependent and independent variables for riverbank erosion using dimensional analysis, based on the Buckingham PI theorem. Two functional relationships were derived from dimensional analysis incorporating the factors governing riverbank erosion. The functional relationships include parameters of hydraulic characteristics of the channel, riverbank geometry and soil characteristics. Parameter estimation was conducted using a linear least squares technique to quantify riverbank erosion rates. The significant independent variables and fourteen models with several numbers of hidden layers were set as the input parameters to the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model performance analysis shows that Models 1 and 9, developed based on the proposed NARX-QR Factorization model, have the highest R2 at 75% and 91%, respectively. Model 1 performed the best with accuracies for training and testing datasets of 75% and 73%, respectively. Additionally, the scatter plot of Model 1 is uniformly distributed along the line of perfect agreement. Therefore, it is concluded that the NARX-QR Factorization model developed in this study performed well in estimating the riverbank erosion rate, particularly for a natural river similar to Sg.

The first part of this paper summarizes the essential knowledge about UAVs, including the fundamentals of flight mechanics and aerodynamics, and the structure of a UAV system. The second section generally explains the modelling and simulation of a UAV. In the main section, more than 50 free programs for the design, analysis, modelling, and simulation of a UAV are described. Although the selection of the free software has been focused on small subsonic UAVs, the software can also be used for other categories of aircraft in some cases; e.g. for MAVs and large gliders. The applications with an historical importance are also included.

As an extension of the conventional terramechanics theory for terrestrial vehicles, the terramechanics theory for planetary rovers, which is becoming a new research hotspot, is unique and puts forward many new challenging problems. This paper first discusses the significance of the study of wheel–soil interaction mechanics of planetary rovers and summarizes the differences between planetary rovers and terrestrial vehicles and the problems arising thereof. The application of terramechanics to the development of planetary rovers can be divided into two phases (the R&D phase and exploration phase for rovers) corresponding to the high-fidelity and simplified terramechanics models. This paper also describes the current research status by providing an introduction to classical terramechanics and the experimental, theoretical, and numerical researches on terramechanics for planetary rovers. The application status of the terramechanics for planetary rovers is analyzed from the aspects of rover design, performance evaluation, planetary soil parameter identification, dynamics simulation, mobility control, and path planning. Finally, the key issues for future research are discussed. The current planetary rovers are actually advanced wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), developed employing cutting-edge technologies from different fields. The terramechanics for planetary rovers is expected to present new challenges and applications for WMRs, making it possible to develop WMRs using the concepts of mechanics and dynamics.","2011-01-01","2024-07-16 05:57:45","2025-07-09 03:55:03","2024-07-16 05:57:43","17-38","","1","4","","Intel Serv Robotics","Planetary rovers’ wheel–soil interaction mechanics","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\C7NSK837\Ding et al. - 2011 - Planetary rovers’ wheel–soil interaction mechanics.pdf","","Control; Terramechanics; Planetary rover; Design and performance evaluation; Dynamics simulation; Soil parameter identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the performance of TC glazing is investigated based on multi-objective optimization for minimizing energy demand while maximizing daylight availability. The effects of five parameters including transition temperature, solar transmittance in clear state, solar transmittance modulation ability, luminous transmittance in clear state, and luminous modulation ability on the building energy consumption and useful daylighting illuminance (UDI300–3000) are examined. Linear Programming Technique for Multi-dimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP) is used for the decision-making of Pareto frontier. This research aims to explore the ideal thermochromic glazing by considering the daylight and energy performance of a typical office room, taking the weather condition of Xiamen, China as an example. Although it is impossible to achieve both optimal values of energy consumption and UDI300–3000 simultaneously, the proposed multi-objective optimization method could still provide low energy consumption with sufficient daylight. The non-dominated sorting of Pareto optimal solution (POS) demonstrated that the optimum building energy consumption and UDI300–3000 for single glazed windows are 46.64 kWh/m2 and 70.92%, respectively, while the values for double glazed windows are 44.40 kWh/m2 and 71.88%, respectively. The selected hypothetical TC windows can improve the building energy and daylighting performance simultaneously when compared with traditional clear single and double glazed windows. The presented framework provides a multi-objective optimization method to determine the most suitable TC glazing technologies for designers and architects during the design and retrofit procedure.","2021-12-01","2024-07-16 05:57:45","2025-07-09 03:53:46","2024-07-16 05:57:44","1685-1695","","6","14","","Build.

CORAMOD is a methodology for the use of model-based systems engineering for requirements analysis of complex products utilizing checklists, the simplest kind of rational design method. The model-based focuses the requirements analysis process on requirement modelling, whereas the checklist encourages a conscious and systematic approach to identify requirements. We illustrate the utility of CORAMOD artefacts by a comprehensive case study example and modelling with system modelling language (SysML).

Network routing needs to be effectively addressed in the IoT environments of scarce computational and energy resources. Accordingly, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has specified the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network (RPL) to provide a bespoke IPv6-based routing framework for IoT networks. However, RPL comes with no Quality of Service (QoS) support which is an essential requirement for many IoT applications. The network research community has introduced a number of research proposals enhancing RPL with different QoS solutions. This paper presents a review of these proposed solutions and aims to establish a firm understanding of recent QoS developments for RPL and possible areas for future IoT routing research. The focus is on comprehending the protocol and networking properties that can affect QoS performance in RPL networks. Consideration is also given to different objective functions developed for addressing varying QoS aspects such as throughput, delay, and packet loss. RPL is also extended in a number of QoS solutions following different approaches at the MAC, network, and application layers.

Modern discrete GPUs (graphics processing units) have been considered to accelerate the performance. However, the data transfer through the PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) bus would reduce gains. On recent architectures, the GPU and the CPU (central processing unit) are built into the same chip which removes the data transmission and offers new performance opportunities. Yet there has been no systematic analysis of grouping and aggregation algorithms on such architectures. In this paper, we study the behaviors of various hash-based grouping and aggregation methods on coupled architectures to provide meaningful guidelines. We conduct an extensive experimental study and analysis on the single CPU, the coupled GPU, and both processors. Six dimensions are considered in analyzing the hashing methods carefully: (1) hashing scheme, (2) hash function, (3) data size, (4) group cardinality, (5) load factor, and (6) data distribution. Two additional dimensions are also explored: (7) shared and independent hash tables and (8) running on single processors and co-processing.

Our ongoing project, called SOPHRA, in collaboration with the City Hospital in Saskatoon, Canada, focuses on supporting care providers (e.g., physicians) in the collection/recording of medical data from patients remotely. A major challenge that needs to be addressed is the potential loss of communication between the mobile-clients and the health information system (HIS) during the transfer of the electronic health record (EHR). Overcoming this challenge will foster soft-real time medical data exchanges. However, the issue of communication loss can be as a result of the over-reliance on wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, which can sometimes be unstable. Thus, the goal of this work is to propose a mobile health (mHealth) architectural environment that can exploit the limited available bandwidth during the mobile medical data transfer. A middleware is proposed with the capability of managing different states of the medical data as the physicians updates the EHR.

While for earthquake hazard-related investigations, the use of remotely sensed data is an established methodological element with a long research tradition, earthquake vulnerability–centred assessments incorporating remote sensing data are increasing primarily in recent years. This goes along with a changing perspective of the scientific community which considers the assessment of vulnerability and its constituent elements as a pivotal part of a comprehensive risk analysis. Thereby, the availability of new sensors systems enables an appreciable share of remote sensing first. In this manner, a survey of the interdisciplinary conceptual literature dealing with the scientific perception of risk, hazard and vulnerability reveals the demand for a comprehensive description of earthquake hazards as well as an assessment of the present and future conditions of the elements exposed. A review of earthquake-related remote sensing literature, realized both in a qualitative and quantitative manner, shows the already existing and published manifold capabilities of remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk. These include earthquake hazard-related analysis such as detection and measurement of lineaments and surface deformations in pre- and post-event applications. Furthermore, pre-event seismic vulnerability–centred assessment of the built and natural environment and damage assessments for post-event applications are presented.

The LCM test is a laboratory test that uses large-scale rock blocks to estimate the real-scale load on disc cutter; the LCM test offers many advantages, but the costs of preparing the rock samples and performing the laboratory test are too high. In addition, the test results from jointed rock blocks are rarely trustworthy because of the difficulty of performing the LCM test with this type of rock sample. To compensate for the failings of the laboratory test, many studies have been conducted to develop a suitable numerical model. However, few studies have investigated the mechanism of rock fragmentation as a function of the joint spacing and the joint direction. This paper presents the results of a Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) of the cutting power exerted on a TBM disc cutter at various joint dip angles, dip directions and spacings. The results show that the cutting power must be increased when the disc cutter advances in a direction opposite to the joint dip. The numerical analysis also shows that the cutting power of a disc cutter increases as the joint dip angle decreases and the joint spacing decreases. Comparing the relationship between the cutting power of the disc cutter and the distribution pattern of the rock joints with the LCM test results can be used to increase the reliability of TBM performance predictions.","2016-01-01","2025-07-09 00:09:35","2025-07-09 03:54:13","","440-451","","1","20","","KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cutting power; disc cutter; Discrete Element Analysis (DEA); jointed rock mass; Linear Cutting Machine (LCM); Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PSSMM is applied to a large-diameter tunnel design project for verification.

We have created a vision-based human locomotion laboratory to capture the healthy and non-healthy gait patterns. A low cost black uniform is taken to capture different person's gait data. This dress is made up with a piece of multiple color ribbon to identify different locations of body joints. It provides an added advantage during separation of different joint locations through color-based segmentation method. The demographic information of each subject helps to understand their gait dynamics. It instigates us to build a musculo-skeletal gait model on OpenSim simulation framework.

In TB bacilli identification, specimens are stained using Ziehl–Neelsen or Auramine dye&nbsp;and are examined by technicians thoroughly for any infectious microbes. For pathological study, the images of these microbes are captured using microscopes and image processing is applied for further analysis. However, choosing 100 field of views (FOV) randomly from a 2 × 1&nbsp;cm square area of sputum specimen may lead to inconsistency in specificity. The examination of specimens is a tedious process, and it requires especially skilled technicians for screening the sputum smear samples. The proposed tuberculosis detection system consists of two subsystems—a data acquisition system and a recognition system. In the data acquisition system, a motorized microscopic stage is designed and developed to automate the acquisition of all FOVs. Here the microscopic stage movement is motorized and scanning patterns are defined by the user for specimen examination. After the acquisition of all FOVs, data are passed to the recognition system. In the recognition system, transfer learning method is implemented by customizing the Inception V3 DeepNet model. This model learns from the pre-trained weights of Inception V3 and classifies the data using support vector machine (SVM) from the transferred knowledge. For training and testing the customized Inception V3 model, a public TB dataset (Shah et al. in J Med Imaging 4(2):027503, 2017. https://doi-org.ezproxy.uniandes.edu.co/10.1117/1.jmi.4.2.027503) and our own acquired microscopic digital dataset are used for analysis. In this&nbsp;model, the fixed feature representations are taken from the top stack layer of Inception V3 DeepNet and are classified using SVM. This model attains an accuracy of 95.05%, thereby reducing the dependency on skilled technicians in the screening process and increasing sensitivity and specificity.","2019-05-01","2025-07-09 01:25:17","2025-07-09 03:53:55","2025-07-09 01:25:17","1533–1545","","5","31","","","RETRACTED ARTICLE","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic solver is developed and connected to a finite beam element model for wing aerostructural optimization. In a quasi-three-dimensional approach an inviscid incompressible vortex lattice method is coupled with a viscous compressible airfoil analysis code for drag prediction of a three dimensional wing. The accuracy of the proposed method for wing drag prediction is validated by comparing its results with the results of a higher fidelity CFD analysis. The wing structural deformation as well as the stress distribution in the wingbox structure is computed using a finite beam element model. The Newton method is used to solve the coupled system. The sensitivities of the outputs, for example the wing drag, with respect to the inputs, for example the wing geometry, is computed by a combined use of the coupled adjoint method, automatic differentiation and the chain rule of differentiation. A gradient based optimization is performed using the proposed tool for minimizing the fuel weight of an A320 class aircraft. The optimization resulted in more than 10 % reduction in the aircraft fuel weight by optimizing the wing planform and airfoils shape as well as the wing internal structure.","2016-10-01","2025-07-09 01:29:09","2025-07-11 02:40:05","2025-07-09 01:29:09","889–906","","4","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\6MJPVGKW\Elham and Tooren - 2016 - Coupled adjoint aerostructural wing optimization using quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic analysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While machine learning algorithms have improved intrusion detection systems in cloud data security, they often fail to consider the entire life cycle of file processing, making it difficult to detect certain issues, especially insider attacks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing data file processing in multi-cloud environments using process mining. By generating a complete file processing event log from a multi-cloud environment, the proposed approach enables detection from both control flow and performance perspectives, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying file processing in its full life cycle.

In this work, the effects of pipe roughness on the performance of a closed-conduit water disinfection UV reactor were investigated. In order to incorporate the surface roughness effects, a simple, stable, highly accurate model, better than any iterative approximation, was adopted in the numerical simulations. The analysis was carried out on the basis of two performance indicators: reduction equivalent dose (RED) and system dose distribution. The analysis was performed using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool (ANSYS Fluent). The fluence rate within the UV reactor was calculated using UVCalc3D. The pipe surface roughness resulted in longer pathogen residence times and higher dose distribution among the pathogens. The effect of pipe surface roughness on RED depends on the Reynolds number and relative roughness. Pipe surface roughness plays an important role because UV reactors for water disinfection operate at moderate Reynolds numbers. In addition, the positioning of the UV lamp in the reactor plays an important role in determining the RED of the reactor. Search criteria for lamp-positioning are also proposed in the current work. The proposed CFD methodology can be used to analyse the performance of closed-conduit reactors for water disinfection by UV.","2016-01-01","2025-07-09 03:32:31","2025-07-09 03:54:13","2025-07-09 03:32:30","","","6","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The calibrated water jet (CWJ, patent # US 8,984,958 B1) can be used to study the effectiveness of BRCs as a function of ship speed. Using a balance of force and linear momentum, we examined the theory and application of the CWJ for simulating the effect of ship speed on biofilm release for surfaces fouled under (1) laboratory and (2) natural conditions. Greater fouling release corresponded with an increase in CWJ pressure and, therefore, simulated ship speed for the surfaces coated with HullKote. The effectiveness of the CWJ was further confirmed for biofilm release from glass fouled naturally by submersion in flow-through seawater. A scaling analysis confirms that the results of these small-scale experiments are applicable to larger-scale biofouling release from ship hulls. This study is the first to utilize the pressure of a CWJ to quantify biofouling release as a function of simulated ship speed.","2024-09","2025-07-09 03:47:27","2025-07-09 03:47:27","2025-07-09 03:47:27","1773-1781","","5","21","","J Coat Technol Res","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\77MFZADB\Shepard et al. - 2024 - Testing for biofilm release as a function of simulated ship speed using a calibrated water jet devic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The forecasting performance of various independent and hybrid machine learning (ML) models are thus quantified for the first time in this work. Utilizing flow velocity measurements in both natural and laboratory flume experiments, we assess the efficacy of four distinct standalone machine learning techniques—Kstar, M5P, reduced error pruning tree (REPT) and random forest (RF) models. In addition, we also test for eight types of hybrid ML algorithms trained with an Additive Regression (AR) and Bagging (BA) (AR-Kstar, AR-M5P, AR-REPT, AR-RF, BA-Kstar, BA-M5P, BA-REPT and BA-RF). Findings from a comparison of their predictive capabilities, along with a sensitivity analysis of the influencing factors, indicated: (1) Vegetation height emerged as the most sensitive parameter for determining the flow velocity; (2) all ML models displayed outperforming empirical equations; (3) nearly all ML algorithms worked optimal when the model was built using all of the input parameters. Overall, the findings showed that hybrid ML algorithms outperform regular ML algorithms and empirical equations at forecasting flow velocity. AR-M5P (R2 = 0.954, R = 0.977, NSE = 0.954, MAE = 0.042, MSE = 0.003, and PBias = 1.466) turned out to be the optimal model for forecasting of flow velocity in vegetated-rivers.","2024-07-16","2025-07-09 03:47:27","2025-07-09 03:47:27","2025-07-09 03:47:27","","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\GDMG8D4B\Kumar et al. - 2024 - AI-driven predictions of geophysical river flows with vegetation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The formed insert is subjected to a controlled densification process and analysed through a series of characterisation investigations. The purpose of the study is to develop the design concept and analyse the forming and sintering parameters used in the lithographic ceramic manufacturing process. The results validated the feasibility of the geometrical design, providing the required structural conformity with the integrated internal feature using conditional specifications. It is confirmed that the forming parameters would affect the material properties of the green body. Furthermore, the results indicate that the heating rate and temperature variance of the de-binding and thermal treatment regime influences the microstructural growth kinetics and the quality of the densified insert. Using a novel application of liquid gallium as an internal coolant, experimental results showed a decrease in tool wear difference of 36% at $$V_{{\text{c}}}$$                                      V                    c                                   = 250 m/min, and 31% in tool wear difference at $$V_{{\text{c}}}$$                                      V                    c                                   = 900 m/min between cooling and non-cooling conditions. When external cooling was applied, the results showed at $$V_{{\text{c}}}$$                                      V                    c                                   = 250 m/min, the difference between the tool wear rates with the internal coolant relative to the external coolant was 29%. Increasing to $$V_{{\text{c}}}$$                                      V                    c                                   = 900 m/min, the results revealed a 16% tool wear difference. The results clearly indicate the potential of liquid gallium as a heat transfer agent in internal cooling applications for cutting inserts, and by extension demonstrable reduction in tool wear.","2024-12","2025-07-09 03:48:35","2025-07-09 03:49:00","2025-07-09 03:48:35","619-641","","4","12","","Adv.

It addresses a literature gap by analysing the radiative impact of blood-based hybrid nanofluids in MHD micropumps. Three blood-based bio-convective radiating hybrid nanofluids—blood—Pt, blood—Au and blood—MWCNT are studied to understand their radiation behaviour in MHD pump while being employed as transportation medium. The investigation employs two non-dimensional parameters, namely Rd (Radiation number) and Ha (Hartmann number), to examine the fluid dynamics, magnetic characteristics, and electrical properties of the MHD micropump. The temperature gradient, velocity distribution, and pressure drop along the flow channel are examined within the specified range of Rd and Ha. Magnetic flux density (MFD) and electric flux intensity (EFI) are evaluated to understand nanoparticle behaviour during drug delivery and blood transportation. Findings highlight that MWCNT and Pt are the most efficient bioconvective nanoparticles for plasma transportation under high radiative conditions. MWCNT-based blood flow exhibits desirable characteristics, including sufficient intake pressure of 4.5 kPa and minimal relative pressure drop of 34%. Coherence between radiation flux and electromagnetic flux reduces pumping power and ensures uniform heat dissipation for improved drug delivery. Au nanoparticles provide moderate magnetic flux density with least fluctuation within the range of Ha and Rd number (2.57 T to 4.39 T), even in highly radiative environments (such as—Rd = 4, Rd = 5), making them suitable for applications like embedded chemotherapy or cell treatment. Au nanoparticles maintain moderate electrical flux intensity with a minimal drop of 16nA, particularly at higher radiative environments influenced by the Radiation number (Rd = 4 to Rd = 5) while Ha values from Ha = 2 to Ha = 4. Conclusively, it has been identified that MWCNT and Au are superior nanofluids for advanced radiative oncological treatments. These nanofluids have the potential to enhance plasma transportation, thermal regulation, and aetilogical disease management. The present study provides significant findings on enhancing the radiation performance in MHD micropumps through utilization of blood-based hybrid nanofluids, thereby offering potential advantages to the domain of biomedical engineering.","2023-10-27","2025-07-09 03:48:35","2025-07-09 03:49:00","2025-07-09 03:48:35","","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\5VPT5ITN\Abid et al. - 2023 - Enhancing radiative efficiency in MHD micropumps using plasma-infused hybrid bioconvective nanofluid.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate predictions of such mechanisms in complex pore geometries require simulation models with local mass conservation and with the option to improve resolution in areas of interest. In this work, we incorporate patch-based, structured adaptive mesh refinement capabilities into a method for local volume conservation that describes the behaviour of disconnected fluid ganglia during level set simulations of capillary-controlled displacement in porous media. We validate the model against analytical solutions for three-phase fluid configurations in idealized pores containing gas, oil, and water, by modelling the intermediate-wet oil layers as separate domains with their volumes preserved. Both the pressures and volumes of disconnected ganglia converge to analytical values with increased refinement levels of the adaptive mesh. Favourable results from strong and weak scaling tests emphasize that the number of patches per processor and the total number of patches are important parameters for efficient parallel simulations with adaptive mesh refinement. Simulations of two-phase imbibition and three-phase gas invasion on segmented 3D images of water-wet sandstone show that adaptive mesh refinement has the highest impact on three-phase displacements, especially concerning the behaviour of the conserved, intermediate-wet phase.","2023-10","2025-07-09 03:50:31","2025-07-09 03:50:31","2025-07-09 03:50:31","707-736","","5","27","","Comput Geosci","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\HBP7H2JP\Singh et al. - 2023 - Adaptive mesh refinement in locally conservative level set methods for multiphase fluid displacement.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the macroscopic theory of PS materials, the effects brought about by the attached FG layer on the piezotronic behaviors of homogeneous n-type PS fibers and PN junctions are investigated. The semi-analytical solutions of the electromechanical fields are obtained by expanding the displacement and carrier concentration variation into power series. Results show that the antisymmetry of the potential and electron concentration distributions in homogeneous n-type PS fibers is destroyed due to the material inhomogeneity of the attached FG layer. In addition, by creating jump discontinuities in the material properties of the FG layer, potential barriers/wells can be produced in the middle of the fiber. Similarly, the potential barrier configuration near the interface of a homogeneous PS PN junction can also be manipulated in this way, which offers a new choice for the design of PN junction based devices.","2022-09","2025-07-09 03:50:31","2025-07-09 03:50:31","2025-07-09 03:50:31","1367-1380","","9","43","","Appl.
