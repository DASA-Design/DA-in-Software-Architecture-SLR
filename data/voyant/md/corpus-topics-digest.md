## Key Observations

1. **Topic Distribution Patterns**:
   - Topic 0 (Dimensional Analysis) dominates in Buckingham's Pi theorem paper (74.95%)
   - Topic 2 (Hardware) is strongest in JPDC paper (42.86%)
   - Topic 3 (Computational Analysis) is significant in multiple papers
   - Topic 4 (Processor Models) peaks in PS-04 (42.57%)

2. **Document Focus**:
   - **Buckingham's Pi**: Strong focus on dimensional analysis and theorems
   - **PS-03**: Balanced between dimensional analysis and computational aspects
   - **PS-04**: Emphasis on processor models and computational forces
   - **Self-similarity**: Equal focus on computational analysis and processor models
   - **Title**: Balanced distribution across analysis, forces, and hardware
   - **JPDC**: Primary focus on hardware and machine characteristics

3. **Cross-cutting Themes**:
   - Computational analysis appears significant in most documents
   - Hardware/machine focus is present across multiple papers
   - Dimensional analysis varies significantly in importance

4. **Topic Relationships**:
   - Topics 3 and 4 often appear together (computational & processor focus)
   - Topics 0 and 1 show some correlation (dimensional analysis & forces)
   - Topic 2 (hardware) appears more isolated in its strongest document
