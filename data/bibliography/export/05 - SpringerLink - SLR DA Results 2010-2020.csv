It is a survey paper that takes a different look at problems involving latency, bandwidth, cache-miss ratios, and the efficiency of parallel numerical algorithms. The Pi Theorem is the fundamental tool of dimensional analysis, and it applies to problems in computer performance analysis just as well as it does to problems in other sciences. Applying it requires the definition of a system of measurement appropriate for computer performance analysis with a consistent set of units and dimensions. Then a straightforward recipe for each specific problem reduces the number of independent variables to a smaller number of dimensionless parameters. Two machines with the same values of these parameters are self-similar and behave the same way. Self-similarity relationships emphasize how machines are the same rather than how they are different. The Pi Theorem is simple to state and simple to prove, using purely algebraic methods, but the results that follow from it are often surprising and not simple at all. The results are often unexpected but they almost always reveal something new about the problem at hand.","2014-02-01","2023-03-04 21:11:31","2025-07-09 03:54:25","2023-03-04 21:11:31","45–71","","1","29","","Comput.

The model was developed based on a 12-month extensive field measurement at Sg. Bernam. This study established the governing factors and derived dependent and independent variables for riverbank erosion using dimensional analysis, based on the Buckingham PI theorem. Two functional relationships were derived from dimensional analysis incorporating the factors governing riverbank erosion. The functional relationships include parameters of hydraulic characteristics of the channel, riverbank geometry and soil characteristics. Parameter estimation was conducted using a linear least squares technique to quantify riverbank erosion rates. The significant independent variables and fourteen models with several numbers of hidden layers were set as the input parameters to the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model performance analysis shows that Models 1 and 9, developed based on the proposed NARX-QR Factorization model, have the highest R2 at 75% and 91%, respectively. Model 1 performed the best with accuracies for training and testing datasets of 75% and 73%, respectively. Additionally, the scatter plot of Model 1 is uniformly distributed along the line of perfect agreement. Therefore, it is concluded that the NARX-QR Factorization model developed in this study performed well in estimating the riverbank erosion rate, particularly for a natural river similar to Sg.

The first part of this paper summarizes the essential knowledge about UAVs, including the fundamentals of flight mechanics and aerodynamics, and the structure of a UAV system. The second section generally explains the modelling and simulation of a UAV. In the main section, more than 50 free programs for the design, analysis, modelling, and simulation of a UAV are described. Although the selection of the free software has been focused on small subsonic UAVs, the software can also be used for other categories of aircraft in some cases; e.g. for MAVs and large gliders. The applications with an historical importance are also included.

As an extension of the conventional terramechanics theory for terrestrial vehicles, the terramechanics theory for planetary rovers, which is becoming a new research hotspot, is unique and puts forward many new challenging problems. This paper first discusses the significance of the study of wheel–soil interaction mechanics of planetary rovers and summarizes the differences between planetary rovers and terrestrial vehicles and the problems arising thereof. The application of terramechanics to the development of planetary rovers can be divided into two phases (the R&D phase and exploration phase for rovers) corresponding to the high-fidelity and simplified terramechanics models. This paper also describes the current research status by providing an introduction to classical terramechanics and the experimental, theoretical, and numerical researches on terramechanics for planetary rovers. The application status of the terramechanics for planetary rovers is analyzed from the aspects of rover design, performance evaluation, planetary soil parameter identification, dynamics simulation, mobility control, and path planning. Finally, the key issues for future research are discussed. The current planetary rovers are actually advanced wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), developed employing cutting-edge technologies from different fields. The terramechanics for planetary rovers is expected to present new challenges and applications for WMRs, making it possible to develop WMRs using the concepts of mechanics and dynamics.","2011-01-01","2024-07-16 05:57:45","2025-07-09 03:55:03","2024-07-16 05:57:43","17-38","","1","4","","Intel Serv Robotics","Planetary rovers’ wheel–soil interaction mechanics","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\C7NSK837\Ding et al. - 2011 - Planetary rovers’ wheel–soil interaction mechanics.pdf","","Control; Terramechanics; Planetary rover; Design and performance evaluation; Dynamics simulation; Soil parameter identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CORAMOD is a methodology for the use of model-based systems engineering for requirements analysis of complex products utilizing checklists, the simplest kind of rational design method. The model-based focuses the requirements analysis process on requirement modelling, whereas the checklist encourages a conscious and systematic approach to identify requirements. We illustrate the utility of CORAMOD artefacts by a comprehensive case study example and modelling with system modelling language (SysML).

Our ongoing project, called SOPHRA, in collaboration with the City Hospital in Saskatoon, Canada, focuses on supporting care providers (e.g., physicians) in the collection/recording of medical data from patients remotely. A major challenge that needs to be addressed is the potential loss of communication between the mobile-clients and the health information system (HIS) during the transfer of the electronic health record (EHR). Overcoming this challenge will foster soft-real time medical data exchanges. However, the issue of communication loss can be as a result of the over-reliance on wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, which can sometimes be unstable. Thus, the goal of this work is to propose a mobile health (mHealth) architectural environment that can exploit the limited available bandwidth during the mobile medical data transfer. A middleware is proposed with the capability of managing different states of the medical data as the physicians updates the EHR. The work details the employment of the Bernoulli model as a means of determining and controlling different updates of the mHealth data for effective propagation.","2018-12-01","2024-07-16 05:58:49","2025-07-09 03:53:59","2024-07-16 05:58:49","1281-1296","","6","20","","Inf Syst Front","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\W7K4PLIW\Lomotey and Deters - 2018 - Middleware for mobile medical data management with.pdf","","Middleware; Cloud computing; Synchronization; Electronic health record; Mobile computing; Mobile devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While for earthquake hazard-related investigations, the use of remotely sensed data is an established methodological element with a long research tradition, earthquake vulnerability–centred assessments incorporating remote sensing data are increasing primarily in recent years. This goes along with a changing perspective of the scientific community which considers the assessment of vulnerability and its constituent elements as a pivotal part of a comprehensive risk analysis. Thereby, the availability of new sensors systems enables an appreciable share of remote sensing first. In this manner, a survey of the interdisciplinary conceptual literature dealing with the scientific perception of risk, hazard and vulnerability reveals the demand for a comprehensive description of earthquake hazards as well as an assessment of the present and future conditions of the elements exposed. A review of earthquake-related remote sensing literature, realized both in a qualitative and quantitative manner, shows the already existing and published manifold capabilities of remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk. These include earthquake hazard-related analysis such as detection and measurement of lineaments and surface deformations in pre- and post-event applications. Furthermore, pre-event seismic vulnerability–centred assessment of the built and natural environment and damage assessments for post-event applications are presented. Based on the review and the discussion of scientific trends and current research projects, first steps towards a roadmap for remote sensing are drawn, explicitly taking scientific, technical, multi- and transdisciplinary as well as political perspectives into account, which is intended to open possible future research activities.","2013-08-01","2024-07-16 06:26:43","2025-07-11 02:40:01","2024-07-16 06:26:41","7-48","","1","68","","Nat Hazards","Remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\63N2D7DM\Geiß and Taubenböck - 2013 - Remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk from a literature review towards a roadmap.pdf; C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\RG88DLAV\Geiß and Taubenböck - 2013 - Remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake r.pdf","","","Earthquake; Hazard; Literature review; Remote sensing; Risk; Roadmap; Vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LCM test is a laboratory test that uses large-scale rock blocks to estimate the real-scale load on disc cutter; the LCM test offers many advantages, but the costs of preparing the rock samples and performing the laboratory test are too high. In addition, the test results from jointed rock blocks are rarely trustworthy because of the difficulty of performing the LCM test with this type of rock sample. To compensate for the failings of the laboratory test, many studies have been conducted to develop a suitable numerical model. However, few studies have investigated the mechanism of rock fragmentation as a function of the joint spacing and the joint direction. This paper presents the results of a Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) of the cutting power exerted on a TBM disc cutter at various joint dip angles, dip directions and spacings. The results show that the cutting power must be increased when the disc cutter advances in a direction opposite to the joint dip. The numerical analysis also shows that the cutting power of a disc cutter increases as the joint dip angle decreases and the joint spacing decreases. Comparing the relationship between the cutting power of the disc cutter and the distribution pattern of the rock joints with the LCM test results can be used to increase the reliability of TBM performance predictions.","2016-01-01","2025-07-09 00:09:35","2025-07-09 03:54:13","","440-451","","1","20","","KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cutting power; disc cutter; Discrete Element Analysis (DEA); jointed rock mass; Linear Cutting Machine (LCM); Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In TB bacilli identification, specimens are stained using Ziehl–Neelsen or Auramine dye&nbsp;and are examined by technicians thoroughly for any infectious microbes. For pathological study, the images of these microbes are captured using microscopes and image processing is applied for further analysis. However, choosing 100 field of views (FOV) randomly from a 2 × 1&nbsp;cm square area of sputum specimen may lead to inconsistency in specificity. The examination of specimens is a tedious process, and it requires especially skilled technicians for screening the sputum smear samples. The proposed tuberculosis detection system consists of two subsystems—a data acquisition system and a recognition system. In the data acquisition system, a motorized microscopic stage is designed and developed to automate the acquisition of all FOVs. Here the microscopic stage movement is motorized and scanning patterns are defined by the user for specimen examination. After the acquisition of all FOVs, data are passed to the recognition system. In the recognition system, transfer learning method is implemented by customizing the Inception V3 DeepNet model. This model learns from the pre-trained weights of Inception V3 and classifies the data using support vector machine (SVM) from the transferred knowledge. For training and testing the customized Inception V3 model, a public TB dataset (Shah et al. in J Med Imaging 4(2):027503, 2017. https://doi-org.ezproxy.uniandes.edu.co/10.1117/1.jmi.4.2.027503) and our own acquired microscopic digital dataset are used for analysis.

A quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic solver is developed and connected to a finite beam element model for wing aerostructural optimization. In a quasi-three-dimensional approach an inviscid incompressible vortex lattice method is coupled with a viscous compressible airfoil analysis code for drag prediction of a three dimensional wing. The accuracy of the proposed method for wing drag prediction is validated by comparing its results with the results of a higher fidelity CFD analysis. The wing structural deformation as well as the stress distribution in the wingbox structure is computed using a finite beam element model. The Newton method is used to solve the coupled system. The sensitivities of the outputs, for example the wing drag, with respect to the inputs, for example the wing geometry, is computed by a combined use of the coupled adjoint method, automatic differentiation and the chain rule of differentiation. A gradient based optimization is performed using the proposed tool for minimizing the fuel weight of an A320 class aircraft. The optimization resulted in more than 10 % reduction in the aircraft fuel weight by optimizing the wing planform and airfoils shape as well as the wing internal structure.","2016-10-01","2025-07-09 01:29:09","2025-07-11 02:40:05","2025-07-09 01:29:09","889–906","","4","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\6MJPVGKW\Elham and Tooren - 2016 - Coupled adjoint aerostructural wing optimization using quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic analysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, the effects of pipe roughness on the performance of a closed-conduit water disinfection UV reactor were investigated. In order to incorporate the surface roughness effects, a simple, stable, highly accurate model, better than any iterative approximation, was adopted in the numerical simulations. The analysis was carried out on the basis of two performance indicators: reduction equivalent dose (RED) and system dose distribution. The analysis was performed using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool (ANSYS Fluent). The fluence rate within the UV reactor was calculated using UVCalc3D. The pipe surface roughness resulted in longer pathogen residence times and higher dose distribution among the pathogens. The effect of pipe surface roughness on RED depends on the Reynolds number and relative roughness. Pipe surface roughness plays an important role because UV reactors for water disinfection operate at moderate Reynolds numbers. In addition, the positioning of the UV lamp in the reactor plays an important role in determining the RED of the reactor. Search criteria for lamp-positioning are also proposed in the current work. The proposed CFD methodology can be used to analyse the performance of closed-conduit reactors for water disinfection by UV.","2016-01-01","2025-07-09 03:32:31","2025-07-09 03:54:13","2025-07-09 03:32:30","","","6","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
