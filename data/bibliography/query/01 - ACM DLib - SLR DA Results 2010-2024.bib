  abstract = {A multitude of problems is likely to arise when developing data models. With dozens of attributes and millions of rows, data modelers are always in danger of inconsistency and inaccuracy. The development of the data model itself could result in difficulties presenting accurate data. The need to improve data models begins with getting it right in the first place. Using real-world examples, Developing High Quality Data Models walks the reader through identifying a number of data modeling principles and analysis techniques that enable the development of data models that both meet business requirements and have a consistent basis. The reader is presented with a variety of generic data model patterns that both exemplify the principles and techniques discussed and build upon one another to give a powerful and integrated generic data model. This model has wide applicability across many disciplines in government and industry, including but not limited to energy exploration, healthcare, telecommunications, transportation, military defense, transportation, and more. * Uses a number of common data model patterns to explain how to develop data models over a wide scope in a way that is consistent and of high quality *Offers generic data model templates that are reusable in many applications and are fundamental for developing more specific templates *Develops ideas for creating consistent approaches to high quality data models},

  abstract = {The development of IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks would facilitate more effective end-to-end IP network architectures, but it remains a challenge. Network routing needs to be effectively addressed in the IoT environments of scarce computational and energy resources. Accordingly, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has specified the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network (RPL) to provide a bespoke IPv6-based routing framework for IoT networks. However, RPL comes with no Quality of Service (QoS) support which is an essential requirement for many IoT applications. The network research community has introduced a number of research proposals enhancing RPL with different QoS solutions. This paper presents a review of these proposed solutions and aims to establish a firm understanding of recent QoS developments for RPL and possible areas for future IoT routing research. The focus is on comprehending the protocol and networking properties that can affect QoS performance in RPL networks. Consideration is also given to different objective functions developed for addressing varying QoS aspects such as throughput, delay, and packet loss. RPL is also extended in a number of QoS solutions following different approaches at the MAC, network, and application layers. However, there is still a need for further developments to address effective QoS support, particularly for dynamic RPL networks.},

The studied parameters were angle of the protective spur dike relative to the flume wall, its length, and its distance from the main spur dikes, flow intensity, and the diameters of the sediment particles that were explored to find the optimum amounts. In prediction phase, a novel hybrid approach was developed, combining adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization (ANFIS–PSO) to predict protective spur dike's parameters in order to control scouring around a series of spur dikes. The results indicated that the accuracy of the proposed method is increased significantly compared to other approaches.

A model-based requirement development may result in significant improvements in engineering design. In current product development activities in this domain, not all requirements are consciously identified and modelled. This paper presents the checklist-oriented requirements analysis modelling (CORAMOD) approach. CORAMOD is a methodology for the use of model-based systems engineering for requirements analysis of complex products utilizing checklists, the simplest kind of rational design method. The model-based focuses the requirements analysis process on requirement modelling, whereas the checklist encourages a conscious and systematic approach to identify requirements. We illustrate the utility of CORAMOD artefacts by a comprehensive case study example and modelling with system modelling language (SysML). We suggest that visual accessibility of the SysML views facilitates the full participation of all stakeholders and enables the necessary dialogue and negotiation. The approach promotes tracing derived requirements to the customer need statement and enhances validation by model execution and simulation.},

They are very effective for conveying dry particulate solids, giving good control over the throughput.

  abstract = {Monitoring and controlling a large-scale spatiotemporal process can be costly and dangerous for human operators, which can delegate the task to mobile robots for improved efficiency at a lower cost. The complex evolution of the spatiotemporal process and limited onboard resources of the robots motivate a holistic design of the robots’ actions to complete the tasks efficiently. This paper describes a cooperative framework for estimating and controlling a spatiotemporal process using a team of mobile robots that have limited onboard resources. We model the spatiotemporal process as a 2D diffusion equation that can characterize the intrinsic dynamics of the process with a partial differential equation (PDE). Measurement and actuation of the diffusion process are performed by mobile robots carrying sensors and actuators. The core of the framework is a nonlinear optimization problem, that simultaneously seeks the actuation and guidance of the robots to control the spatiotemporal process subject to the PDE dynamics. The limited onboard resources are formulated as inequality constraints on the actuation and speed of the robots. Extensive numerical studies analyze and evaluate the proposed framework using nondimensionalization and compare the optimal strategy to baseline strategies. The framework is demonstrated on an outdoor multi-quadrotor testbed using hardware-in-the-loop simulations.}

  abstract = {Nowadays, virtual manufacturing, digitalisation and simulation predictions are essential for the design and the development of engineering parts and components, as well as companies’ productivity. The implemented constitutive model and the accuracy of the determined material parameters influence the reliability of these predictions. It is necessary to calibrate multiple parameters of a complex and robust constitutive model. This is a very time-consuming task and involves high costs when using a classical approach, in which several different homogeneous mechanical experiments are performed. The non-homogeneous mechanical tests can provide a larger variety of mechanical information in just one experiment, reducing the number of required tests for material characterisation. The aim of this work is to numerically design a specimen with an interior notch for a uniaxial loading test that presents strain heterogeneity. The shape of the interior notch is optimised to maximise the strain heterogeneity. The optimisation procedure is guided by a cost function established by several strain heterogeneity indicators. The best specimen shape exhibits numerically uniaxial tension and compression, pure shear and plane strain tension in the plastic region. The identifiability of Swift’s hardening law parameters was quantitatively investigated based on the partial derivative of the strain fields with respect to the sought parameters. Results show that the proposed design strategy enables to increase in strain heterogeneity. It is shown that the optimised specimen has significantly better identifiability compared to a tensile specimen with a circular hole. Finally, a comparison between a classical Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) methodology and a FEMU-based approach that uses a DIC-levelling strategy was conducted in order to inversely identify the Swift hardening law parameters and validate the designed specimen. It was confirmed that the DIC-levelling method finds more accurate results than the classical approach, with the compromise of the computational time. It was also shown that the optimum designed specimen is adequate for inverse identification strategies.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is a disease with significant prevalence in several countries around the world. Its difficult treatment and rapid progression make the mortality rates among people affected by this illness to be very high. Aiming to offer a computational alternative for helping in detection of nodules, serving as a second opinion to the specialists, this work proposes a totally automatic methodology based on successive detection refining stages. The automated lung nodules detection scheme consists of six stages: thorax extraction, lung extraction, lung reconstruction, structures extraction, tubular structures elimination, and false positive reduction. In the thorax extraction stage all the artifacts external to the patient’s body are discarded. Lung extraction stage is responsible for the identification of the lung parenchyma. The objective of the lung reconstruction stage is to prevent incorrect elimination of portions belonging to the parenchyma. Structures extraction stage comprises the selection of dense structures from inside the lung parenchyma. The next stage, tubular structures elimination eliminates a great part of the pulmonary trees. Finally, the false positive stage selects only structures with great probability to be nodule. Each of the several stages has very specific objectives in detection of particular cases of lung nodules, ensuring good matching rates even in difficult detection situations. We use 33 exams with diversified diagnosis and slices numbers for validating the methodology. We obtained a false positive per exam rate of 0.42 and false negative rate of 0.15. The total classification sensitivity obtained, measured out of the nodule candidates, was 84.84\%. The specificity achieved was 96.15\% and the total accuracy of the method was 95.21\%.},

  abstract = {Microscopy is a rapid diagnosis method for many infectious diseases like tuberculosis (TB). In TB bacilli identification, specimens are stained using Ziehl–Neelsen or Auramine dye\&nbsp;and are examined by technicians thoroughly for any infectious microbes. For pathological study, the images of these microbes are captured using microscopes and image processing is applied for further analysis. However, choosing 100 field of views (FOV) randomly from a 2\,×\,1\&nbsp;cm square area of sputum specimen may lead to inconsistency in specificity. The examination of specimens is a tedious process, and it requires especially skilled technicians for screening the sputum smear samples. The proposed tuberculosis detection system consists of two subsystems—a data acquisition system and a recognition system. In the data acquisition system, a motorized microscopic stage is designed and developed to automate the acquisition of all FOVs. Here the microscopic stage movement is motorized and scanning patterns are defined by the user for specimen examination. After the acquisition of all FOVs, data are passed to the recognition system. In the recognition system, transfer learning method is implemented by customizing the Inception V3 DeepNet model. This model learns from the pre-trained weights of Inception V3 and classifies the data using support vector machine (SVM) from the transferred knowledge. For training and testing the customized Inception V3 model, a public TB dataset (Shah et al. in J Med Imaging 4(2):027503, 2017. https://doi-org.ezproxy.uniandes.edu.co/10.1117/1.jmi.4.2.027503) and our own acquired microscopic digital dataset are used for analysis. In this\&nbsp;model, the fixed feature representations are taken from the top stack layer of Inception V3 DeepNet and are classified using SVM. This model attains an accuracy of 95.05\%, thereby reducing the dependency on skilled technicians in the screening process and increasing sensitivity and specificity.}

  abstract = {With the increasing challenges facing planetary exploration missions and the resultant increase in the performance requirements for planetary rovers, terramechanics (wheel–soil interaction mechanics) is playing an important role in the development of these rovers. As an extension of the conventional terramechanics theory for terrestrial vehicles, the terramechanics theory for planetary rovers, which is becoming a new research hotspot, is unique and puts forward many new challenging problems. This paper first discusses the significance of the study of wheel–soil interaction mechanics of planetary rovers and summarizes the differences between planetary rovers and terrestrial vehicles and the problems arising thereof. The application of terramechanics to the development of planetary rovers can be divided into two phases (the R\&D phase and exploration phase for rovers) corresponding to the high-fidelity and simplified terramechanics models. This paper also describes the current research status by providing an introduction to classical terramechanics and the experimental, theoretical, and numerical researches on terramechanics for planetary rovers. The application status of the terramechanics for planetary rovers is analyzed from the aspects of rover design, performance evaluation, planetary soil parameter identification, dynamics simulation, mobility control, and path planning. Finally, the key issues for future research are discussed. The current planetary rovers are actually advanced wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), developed employing cutting-edge technologies from different fields. The terramechanics for planetary rovers is expected to present new challenges and applications for WMRs, making it possible to develop WMRs using the concepts of mechanics and dynamics.},

It is important to determine and/or predict the magnitude, nature and direction of the residual stress to estimate the life of important engineering parts, particularly welded components. Researchers have developed many direct measuring techniques for welding residual stress. Intelligent techniques have been developed to predict residual stresses to meet the demands of advanced manufacturing planning. This research paper explores the development of Finite Element model and evolutionary fuzzy support vector regression model for the prediction of residual stress in welding. Residual stress model is developed using Finite Element Simulation. Results from Finite Element Method (FEM) model are used to train and test the developed Fuzzy Support Vector Regression model tuned with Genetic Algorithm (FSVRGA) using K-fold cross validation method. The performance of the developed model is compared with Support Vector Regression model and Fuzzy Support Vector Regression model. The proposed and developed model is superior in terms of computational speed and accuracy. Developed models are validated and reported.

A quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic solver is developed and connected to a finite beam element model for wing aerostructural optimization. In a quasi-three-dimensional approach an inviscid incompressible vortex lattice method is coupled with a viscous compressible airfoil analysis code for drag prediction of a three dimensional wing. The accuracy of the proposed method for wing drag prediction is validated by comparing its results with the results of a higher fidelity CFD analysis. The wing structural deformation as well as the stress distribution in the wingbox structure is computed using a finite beam element model. The Newton method is used to solve the coupled system. The sensitivities of the outputs, for example the wing drag, with respect to the inputs, for example the wing geometry, is computed by a combined use of the coupled adjoint method, automatic differentiation and the chain rule of differentiation. A gradient based optimization is performed using the proposed tool for minimizing the fuel weight of an A320 class aircraft. The optimization resulted in more than 10 \% reduction in the aircraft fuel weight by optimizing the wing planform and airfoils shape as well as the wing internal structure.},

Intelligent information systems use artificial intelligence to enhance system performance, giving the enterprise a competitive advantage. This paper uses ontology technology for user requirements analysis—defining the class, slot, and instance of the ontology—and then designs the system architecture based on that ontology. In accordance with the firm’s requirements, we build a data warehouse system that is integrated with different data sources within the enterprise and that supports a web-based interface in the Internet of Things (IoT). The system also supports the standard queries, reports, summary tables, and datasets required for data mining. The proposed data mining method for manufacturing industries that use Bayesian network incorporates Bayesian theory and graphical models and can predict causal and probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. Our results bring information system functionality closer to satisfying the real-world needs of business. The proposed system can reduce production cycle times, increase the speed and accuracy with which production information is analyzed, and offer predictions that can be used for better business decisions. Data mining technology can improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes by using feedback data to tune the manufacturing parameters and improve the accuracy of yield rate predictions, giving the firm a greater competitive advantage.}

In this paper, we introduce a modeling and analysis framework based on continuous computations and zero-bit message channels, and employ this framework for the correctness \&amp; performance analysis of a distributed fault-tolerant clocking approach for Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). Starting out from a "classic" distributed Byzantine fault-tolerant tick generation algorithm, we show how to adapt it for direct implementation in clockless digital logic, and rigorously prove its correctness and derive analytic expressions for worst case performance metrics like synchronization precision and clock frequency. Rather than on absolute delay values, both the algorithm's correctness and the achievable synchronization precision depend solely on the ratio of certain path delays. Since these ratios can be mapped directly to placement \&amp; routing constraints, there is typically no need for changing the algorithm when migrating to a faster implementation technology and/or when using a slightly different layout in an SoC.},

Therefore, narrowing the separation between these two platforms remains as a research problem. This literature review elaborates the divide between physical and digital design, testing and manufacturing techniques in the morphological process of architectural form. We first review the digital transformation in the architectural design discourse. Then, we proceed by introducing a variety of methods that are integrating digital and physical workflows and suggesting an alternative approach.

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for constructing optimal design of experiments (DoE) intended for building surrogate models using dimensionless (or non-dimensional) variables. In order to increase the fidelity of the model obtained by regression, the DoE needs to optimally cover the dimensionless space. However, in order to generate the data for the regression, one still needs a DoE for the physical variables, in order to carry out the simulations. Thus, there exist two spaces, each one needing a DoE. Since the dimensionless space is always smaller than the physical one, the challenge for building a DoE is that the relation between the two spaces is not bijective. Moreover, each space usually has its own domain constraints, which renders them not-surjective. This means that it is impossible to design the DoE in one space and then automatically generate the corresponding DoE in the other space while satisfying the constraints from both spaces. The solution proposed in the paper transforms the computation of the DoE into an optimization problem formulated in terms of a space-filling criterion (maximizing the minimum distance between neighboring points). An approach is proposed for efficiently solving this optimization problem in a two steps procedure. The method is particularly well suited for building surrogates in terms of dimensionless variables spanning several orders of magnitude (e.g. power laws). The paper also proposes some variations of the method; one when more control is needed on the number of levels on each non-dimensional variable and another one when a good distribution of the DoE is desired in the logarithmic scale. The DoE construction method is illustrated on three case studies. A purely numerical case illustrates each step of the method and two other, mechanical and thermal, case studies illustrate the results in different configurations and different practical aspects.},

  abstract = {Normal logic programs subject to stable model semantics cover reasoning problems from the first level of polynomial time hierarchy (PH) in a natural way. Disjunctive programs reach one level beyond this, but the access to the underlying NP oracle(s) is somewhat implicit and available for the programmer using the so-called saturation technique. To address this shortcoming, stable-unstable semantics was proposed, making oracles explicit as subprograms having no stable models. If this idea is applied recursively, any level of PH can be reached with normal programs only, in analogy to quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs). However, for the moment, no native implementations of stable-unstable semantics have emerged except via translations toward QBFs. In this work, we alleviate this situation with a translation of (effectively) normal programs that combines a main program with any fixed number of oracles subject to stable-unstable semantics. The result is a disjunctive program that can be fed as input for answer set solvers supporting disjunctive programs. The idea is to hide saturation from the programmer altogether, although it is exploited by the translation internally. The translation of oracles is performed using translators and linkers from the ASPTOOLS collection while Clingo is used as the back-end solver.},

The logical chaotic map is used for population initialization, and then the Lévy flight mechanism is integrated into the SCLBOA algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the SCLBOA, we conducted many experiments on standard test functions. The simulation results suggest that the SCLBOA is capable of high-precision optimization, fast convergence, and effective global optimization, all of which show that our method outperforms other methods in solving mathematical optimization problems. Finally, the BP network is optimized according to the SCLBOA (SCLBOA-BP) to further verify the availability of the algorithm.

In order to balance the checkpointing overhead and the loss of computation on recovery, the authors propose a hybrid checkpointing algorithm, wherein an all-process coordinated checkpoint is taken after the execution of minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm for a fixed number of times. In coordinated checkpointing, if a single process fails to take its checkpoint; all the checkpointing effort goes waste, because, each process has to abort its tentative checkpoint. In order to take the tentative checkpoint, an MH Mobile Host needs to transfer large checkpoint data to its local MSS over wireless channels. In this regard, the authors propose that in the first phase, all concerned MHs will take soft checkpoint only. Soft checkpoint is similar to mutable checkpoint. In this case, if some process fails to take checkpoint in the first phase, then MHs need to abort their soft checkpoints only. The effort of taking a soft checkpoint is negligibly small as compared to the tentative one. In the minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm, an effort has been made to minimize the number of useless checkpoints and blocking of processes using probabilistic approach.},

  abstract = {The call stack is a trace of function calls when a program is running. By analyzing the call stack, we can learn the execution path of the program, the relationship between functions and the number of function calls, which is of great significance for program optimization and troubleshooting. However, the call stack information is often very large, especially in complex application scenarios, the analysis and processing efficiency is very low, or even impossible to complete. Therefore, efficient statistics and analysis tools for the call stack are particularly important. This paper proposes an resource usage anomaly detection scheme for process behavior based on call stack coding and anomaly detection algorithm. It obtains the call stack by eBPF technology and establishes a hash table by map mechanism. It samples the call stack codes of all processes running in the machine at a specific frequency during the detection, and records the number of samples and execution time of each different call stack code. A user mode program reads data from the buffer. The call stack statistics is analyzed in user space, and the abnormal number of process call stacks is found by anomaly detection algorithm every period of time, which is convenient to find the call bottleneck of the machine causing high load. The abnormal call stacks are used to optimize the program and improve the performance of the machine, and are compatible with the data collected by Perf. The tool is efficient, accurate, scalable, and can quickly locate performance problems in the production environment.},

  abstract = {A promise of mHealth is its capacity to facilitate the consumption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data using mobile devices, which is central to promoting remote healthcare delivery. Our ongoing project, called SOPHRA, in collaboration with the City Hospital in Saskatoon, Canada, focuses on supporting care providers (e.g., physicians) in the collection/recording of medical data from patients remotely. A major challenge that needs to be addressed is the potential loss of communication between the mobile-clients and the health information system (HIS) during the transfer of the electronic health record (EHR). Overcoming this challenge will foster soft-real time medical data exchanges. However, the issue of communication loss can be as a result of the over-reliance on wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, which can sometimes be unstable. Thus, the goal of this work is to propose a mobile health (mHealth) architectural environment that can exploit the limited available bandwidth during the mobile medical data transfer. A middleware is proposed with the capability of managing different states of the medical data as the physicians updates the EHR. The work details the employment of the Bernoulli model as a means of determining and controlling different updates of the mHealth data for effective propagation.},

We mined these logs to analyze the I/O behavior of applications across all their runs on a platform; the evolution of an application's I/O behavior across time, and across platforms; and the I/O behavior of a platform's entire workload. Our analysis techniques can help developers and platform owners improve I/O performance and I/O system utilization, by quickly identifying underperforming applications and offering early intervention to save system resources. We summarize our observations regarding how jobs perform I/O and the throughput they attain in practice.},

  abstract = {We propose the novel visual analysis system Video of Things (VoT) using machine learning and a distributed Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. The VoT-enabled approach is proposed to perform a visual analysis of action in the context of wireless sensor systems. For the technical impact analysis of VoT, we used the EM algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the notion of merging the clustered grid with the uniform filter in the target tracking of the distributed EM of particle filtering. We grid the network monitoring region with the technical impact analysis of VoT, then clusters the whole sensor nodes, build the system structure using a real scenario of visual actions in the VoT, and thoroughly analyze the system implementation process. Finally, we present investigations to validate the performance of the proposed research approach with a technical impact analysis of VoT. According to the study findings, the proposed VoT-based system can play an essential role in the recognition and technical impact analysis of table tennis activity.},

Notable English contributors include Veiga and Gonio, while Chinese literature lacks central authors. Research concentrates on land-based training, pivotal training methods, pre-competition preparation, post-intensity recovery, and starts and turns. Key terms are adolescents, physical training, swimming, performance, and competition analysis. Recent hot topics in Chinese research include physical and load training methods, while "Elite athlete" trends in English literature.Conclusion: Adolescent breaststroke training requires customization over standardization. Tailored plans should reflect individual physical and psychological traits, technique style, skill level, coaching, and regional factors for optimal results.},

  abstract = {The analysis of human gait dynamics allows an individual to obtain interesting biometric features through which gait disturbances can be observed from normal and abnormal gait patterns. The musculo-skeletal modeling of human movement helps to study the gait dynamics with expected simulations. It encourages the clinicians to identify the pathological gait for proper treatment. We have created a vision-based human locomotion laboratory to capture the healthy and non-healthy gait patterns. A low cost black uniform is taken to capture different person's gait data. This dress is made up with a piece of multiple color ribbon to identify different locations of body joints. It provides an added advantage during separation of different joint locations through color-based segmentation method. The demographic information of each subject helps to understand their gait dynamics. It instigates us to build a musculo-skeletal gait model on OpenSim simulation framework. The Regression Analysis (RA) technique is applied on crouch and healthy gait feature to measure the generalization ability and to uncover the gait profiles which are estimated by different error metrics such as, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Standard Deviation of Error (SDE), and Mean Error (ME). A computational method based on Normalized Auto Correlation (NAC) is computed to measure the gait disturbances in training subjects. The performance analysis of regression model on motion captured data has been validated with subject specific musculo-skeletal gait model on OpenSim platform.}

  abstract = {This paper applies the Pi Theorem of dimensional analysis to a representative set of examples from computer performance analysis. It is a survey paper that takes a different look at problems involving latency, bandwidth, cache-miss ratios, and the efficiency of parallel numerical algorithms. The Pi Theorem is the fundamental tool of dimensional analysis, and it applies to problems in computer performance analysis just as well as it does to problems in other sciences. Applying it requires the definition of a system of measurement appropriate for computer performance analysis with a consistent set of units and dimensions. Then a straightforward recipe for each specific problem reduces the number of independent variables to a smaller number of dimensionless parameters. Two machines with the same values of these parameters are self-similar and behave the same way. Self-similarity relationships emphasize how machines are the same rather than how they are different. The Pi Theorem is simple to state and simple to prove, using purely algebraic methods, but the results that follow from it are often surprising and not simple at all. The results are often unexpected but they almost always reveal something new about the problem at hand.},

Computer systems are self-similar if certain ratios of computational forces, also known as computational intensities, are equal. Two machines with different computational power, different network bandwidth and different inter-processor latency behave the same way if they have the same ratios of forces. For the parallel conjugate gradient algorithm studied in this paper, two machines are self-similar if and only if the ratio of one force describing latency effects to another force describing bandwidth effects is the same for both machines. For the two machines studied in this paper, this ratio, which we call the mixing coefficient, is invariant as problem size and processor count change. The two machines have the same mixing coefficient and belong to the same equivalence class.},

  abstract = {With the growing complexity of computational and experimental facilities, many scientific researchers are turning to machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze large scale ensemble data. With complexities such as multi-component workflows, heterogeneous machine architectures, parallel file systems, and batch scheduling, care must be taken to facilitate this analysis in a high performance computing (HPC) environment. In this paper, we present Merlin, a workflow framework to enable large ML-friendly ensembles of scientific HPC simulations. By augmenting traditional HPC with distributed compute technologies, Merlin~aims to lower the barrier for scientific subject matter experts to incorporate ML into their analysis. As a producer–consumer workflow model, Merlin~enables multi-machine, cross-batch job, dynamically allocated yet persistent workflows capable of utilizing surge-compute resources. Key features of Merlin~are a flexible HPC-centric interface, low per-task overhead, multi-tiered fault recovery, and a hierarchical sampling algorithm that allows for O(N) task execution and O(NlnN) task queuing to ensembles of millions of tasks. In addition to Merlin’s design, we test the algorithm’s performance in an HPC center and demonstrate the ability to enqueue 40 million simulations in 100~s, with a 30 millisecond per-task overhead that is independent of ensemble size. Finally, we describe some example applications that Merlin~has enabled on leadership-class HPC resources, such as the ML-augmented optimization of nuclear fusion experiments and the calibration of infectious disease models to study the progression of and possible mitigation strategies for COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Earth scientists are increasingly experiencing difficulties with analyzing rapidly growing volumes of complex data. Those who must perform analysis directly on low-level National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 1B calibrated and geolocated data, for example, encounter an arcane, high-volume data set that is burdensome to make use of. Instead, Earth scientists typically opt to use higher-level "canned" products provided by NASA. However, when these higher-level products fail to meet the requirements of a particular project, a cruel dilemma arises: cope with data products that don't exactly meet the project's needs or spend an enormous amount of resources extracting what is needed from the unadulterated low-level data. In this paper, we present EarthDB, a system that eliminates this dilemma by offering the following contributions:1. Enabling painless importing of MODIS Level 1B data into SciDB, a highly scalable science-oriented database platform that abstracts away the complexity of distributed storage and analysis of complex multi-dimensional data,2. Defining a schema that unifies storage and representation of MODIS Level 1B data, regardless of its source file,3. Supporting fast filtering and analysis of MODIS data through the use of an intuitive, high-level query language rather than complex procedural programming and,4. Providing the ability to easily define and reconfigure entire analysis pipelines within the SciDB database, allowing for rapid ad-hoc analysis. To demonstrate this ability, we provide sample benchmarks for the construction of true-color (RGB) and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) images from raw MODIS Level 1B data using relatively simple queries with scalable performance.},

We compare the transaction model to the family of multiframe models, then present the exact, and approximated methods, as well as a tunable method to compute the RTA. Finally we present a new schedulability analysis method and an efficient algorithm to speed up this test.},

The recent advances in RF signal routing demands high efficiency offering SPMT RF switches. This communication discusses the design of SPMT switches using ohmic contact RF MEMS technology for RF signal routing applications. The ohmic contact switches are designed using multi-contact cantilever structures. The cantilever structure is incorporated in the CPW line without disturbing the RF properties. The multi-contact cantilever structures helps to improve the reliability of microstructures. The presented SPMT switch was enabled with reconfigurability feature in terms of frequency. Three identical ohmic contact switches are used for the design of SPMT switch. The switch requires a low Actuation voltage of 3.5\&nbsp;V.

In earlier studies, the recommendation systems classify the reviews of products as positive or negative, verbatim on the features contained in the reviews, without reference to their context. In this paper, we develop an Ontology and Context Based Recommendation System (OCBRS) to assess the context of and determine the opinion of the review. We propose a Neuro-Fuzzy Classification approach using fuzzy rules to extract the context of the review. This approach automatically classifies the reviews under the respective fuzzy rule. Ontology facilitates a hierarchical and systematic methodology to group the context and acts as repository of context. The proposed approach appears to improve the accuracy of the RS.},

  abstract = {Clusters of mobile elements, such as vehicles and humans, are a common mobility pattern of interest for many applications. The on-line detection of them from large position streams of mobile entities is a challenging task because it requires algorithms that are capable of continuously and efficiently processing the high volume of position updates in a timely manner. Currently, the majority of approaches for cluster detection operate in batch mode, where position updates are recorded during time periods of certain length and then batch processed by an external routine, thus delaying the result of the cluster detection until the end of the time period. However, if the monitoring application requires results at a higher frequency than the one delivered by batch algorithms, then results might not reflect the current clustering state of the entities. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose DG2CEP, an algorithm that combines the well-known density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN with the data stream processing paradigm Complex Event Processing (CEP) to achieve continuous, on-line detection of clusters. Our experiments with synthetic and real world datasets indicate that DG2CEP is able to detect the formation and dispersion of clusters with small latency and higher similarity to DBSCAN's output than batch-based approaches. HighlightsWe present an on-line algorithm (DG2CEP) for clustering position data streams.DG2CEP combines data stream mining with complex event processing concepts.DG2CEP can detect both the formation and the dispersion of clusters as data pass.Experimental results demonstrate that DG2CEP can rapidly detect cluster formations.Experiments also show that DG2CEP results are highly similar to off-line approaches (DBSCAN).},

  abstract = {Background. Based on personal experience of ski teaching, ski training and ski competing, we have noticed that some gaps exist between classical models describing body-techniques and actual motor acts made by performing athletes. The evolution of new parabolic shaped skis with new mechanical and geometric characteristics increase these differences even more. Generally, scientific research focuses on situations where skiers are separated from their skis. Also, many specialized magazines, handbooks and papers print articles with similar epistemology. In this paper, we describe the development of a three-dimensional analysis to model the skier-skis' system. We subsequently used the model to propose an evaluation template to coaches that includes eight techniques and three observable consequences in order to make objective evaluations of their athletes' body-techniques. Once the system is modeled, we can develop a computer simulation in the form of a jumping jack, respecting degrees of freedom of the model. We can manipulate movement of each body segment or skis' gears' characteristics to detect performance variations. The purpose of this project is to elaborate assumptions to improve performance and propose experimental protocols to coaches to enable them to evaluate performance. This computer simulation also involves board and wheeled sports.Methods. Eleven elite alpine skiers participated. Video cameras were used to observe motor acts in alpine skiers in two tasks: slalom and giant slalom turns. Kinematic data were input into the 3D Vision software. Two on-board balances were used to measure the six components of ski-boots→skis torques. All data sources were then synchronized.Findings. We found correlations between force and torque measurements, the progression of center of pressure and the eight body-techniques. Based on these results, we created a technological model of the skier-ski system. Then, we have made a reading template and a model to coach young alpine skiers in clubs and world cup alpine skiers and, we have obtained results demonstrating the usefulness of our research.Interpretation. These results suggest that it is now possible to create a three-dimensional simulator of an alpine skier. This tool is able to compare competitors' body-techniques to detect the most performing body-techniques. Additionally, it is potentially helpful to consider and evaluate new techniques and ski characteristics.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel and comprehensive model development technique to predict the riverbank erosion rate for a natural channel using a Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs and QR factorization parameter estimation, known as the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model was developed based on a 12-month extensive field measurement at Sg. Bernam. This study established the governing factors and derived dependent and independent variables for riverbank erosion using dimensional analysis, based on the Buckingham PI theorem. Two functional relationships were derived from dimensional analysis incorporating the factors governing riverbank erosion. The functional relationships include parameters of hydraulic characteristics of the channel, riverbank geometry and soil characteristics. Parameter estimation was conducted using a linear least squares technique to quantify riverbank erosion rates. The significant independent variables and fourteen models with several numbers of hidden layers were set as the input parameters to the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model performance analysis shows that Models 1 and 9, developed based on the proposed NARX-QR Factorization model, have the highest R2 at 75\% and 91\%, respectively. Model 1 performed the best with accuracies for training and testing datasets of 75\% and 73\%, respectively. Additionally, the scatter plot of Model 1 is uniformly distributed along the line of perfect agreement. Therefore, it is concluded that the NARX-QR Factorization model developed in this study performed well in estimating the riverbank erosion rate, particularly for a natural river similar to Sg. Bernam.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid version of marine predator algorithm (MPA) and naked mole-rat algorithm (NMRA) to aggregate the strengths of both algorithms. The new proposed algorithm is named as MpNMRA and designed to overcome the inherent drawbacks of MPA (slow exploitation) and NMRA (limited exploration). The algorithm adds the basic structure of MPA to the worker phase of NMRA, while keeping all the major parameters of both the algorithm. The major parameters of both the algorithms are subjected to four different mutation strategies namely, exponential, linear, simulated annealing and logarithmic mutation strategies. The concept of simulated annealing-based mutation is found to be best for most of the parameters, whereas in some cases exponentially decreasing weights provide better results. Leveraging on the best mutation strategies for all the parameters, the proposed MpNMRA is tested on CEC2005, CEC2014 and CEC 2019 benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate that MpNMRA provides best results when compared to other algorithms in the literature on higher-dimensional problems. This work also considers solving three real-world optimization problems and training of a multi-layer perceptron using the proposed algorithm. Statistical results obtained from Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, Freidman’s test and computational complexity further proves that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient and provide superior results.11The link of source-code will be added after publishing.},

This characterization is formulated in terms of the population covariance of the features. Our work is partially motivated by the problem of learning with Gaussian rainbow neural networks, namely deep non-linear fully-connected networks with random but structured weights, whose row-wise covariances are further allowed to depend on the weights of previous layers. For such networks we also derive a closed-form formula for the feature covariance in terms of the weight matrices. We further find that in some cases our results can capture feature maps learned by deep, finite-width neural networks trained under gradient descent.}

The security of VR devices directly impacts user authentication and privacy. Currently, no attention has been paid to the vulnerabilities and security risks of VR devices. This article employs a bi-layer BiLSTM neural network to conduct a root cause analysis for user authentication and scene interaction when users enter metaverse environment using VR devices. By establishing the mapping between vulnerable VR firmware file attributes and metaverse interaction scenarios, we implement a vulnerability discovery and verification prototype called VRVul-Discovery, based on the concept of vulnerability discovery. Experiment results demonstrate that VRVul-Discovery provides high-accuracy determinations of firmware vulnerability attributes and scenarios susceptible to hijacking. In the end, the prototype system discovers seven unknown vulnerabilities, all of which are authenticated.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-strategy, multiple algorithms based hybrid strategy using flower pollination algorithm (FPA), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), INFO, and naked mole rat algorithm (NMRA). The proposed algorithm, named the Flower Grey INFO Naked (FGIN) algorithm, incorporates the most effective equations from the FPA, GWO, INFO, and NMRA. Here FPA’s basic structure following global and local search is used, GWO is meant for providing extensive exploration, whereas INFO and NMRA both contribute towards exploitative search. Dynamic iterative search and population segmentation strategies are incorporated for enhanced performance of FGIN algorithm. For enhanced self-adaptivity, six mutation weight operators are applied to the three parameters of the proposed strategy. FGIN is also subjected to higher dimensional and variable population analysis, and has been found to be highly effective. A deeper analysis using CEC 2005, CEC 2017, CEC 2019 and CEC 2022 benchmark data set is also performed to validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm with respect to success history based differential evolution (SHADE), self-adaptive DE (SaDE), NL-LSHADE-LBC, DE with active archive (JADE), LSHADE-SPACMA, evolutionary algorithms with eigen crossover (EA4eig), extended GWO (GWO-E), NL-LSHADE-RSP-MID, jDE100, and others. The proposed FIGN algorithm is then used for the parametric identification of proton exchange membranes in fuel cells (PEMFC). The optimization challenge of PEMFC is to minimize the sum of squared error (SSE) between the experimental and measured voltage. And also determine, the optimal values of seven unknown parameters for the PEMFC stack’s. To illustrate the potential of the FGIN algorithm is validated by utilizing five well-known commercial PEMFCs, namely NedStack PS6, BCS 500 W, Stack 250 W, Ballard Mark V, and Horizon H-12 Stack. In order to check the effectiveness of the FGIN algorithm, both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests have been conducted, and it has been found that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better.},

  abstract = {Large data centers are usually built to support increasing computational and data storage demand of growing global business and industry, which consume an enormous amount of energy, at a huge cost to both business and the environment. However, much of that energy is wasted to maintain excess service capacity during periods of low load. In this paper, we investigate the problem of “right-sizing” data center for energy-efficiency through virtualization which allows consolidation of workloads into smaller number of servers while dynamically powering off the idle ones. In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics. Solving this model, we notice that there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption and performance. We hereby develop a BFGS based algorithm to optimize the tradeoff by searching for the optimal system parameter values for the data center operators to “right-size” the data centers. We implement our Stochastic Right-sizing Model (SRM) and deploy it in the real-world cloud data center. Experiments with two real-world workload traces show that SRM can significantly reduce the energy consumption while maintaining high performance.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is the most commonly used imaging during pregnancy for tracking the fetus's growth and monitoring other biological parameters. The assessment of the development of the baby's growth requires imaging-based analysis in every trimester. The automatic computerized software and systems provide the platform for radiologists to more accurately access the fetus's head circumference as compared to manual estimation. The improvement of such computerized algorithms is always the key demand to improve accuracy and precision. This paper proposes an improved encoder-decoder model for the segmentation of the fetal head segmentation in 2D-ultrasound images. The proposed model uses regression in combination with attention to the encoder-decoder model to determine the fetus's head circumference. The model is further extended with the post-processing ellipse fitting to superimpose the segmentation region on ultrasound images for clear visualization of the fetus's head. Further, the proposed model performance is evaluated by using various statistical measures using segmented regions and available ground truth. The experimental results demonstrate a similarity score of 94.56\%. The comparative result suggests that the proposed model is providing a more accurate fetus head segmentation region on 2D-ultrasound images as compared to other existing approaches.},

In this study, a SCI system is constructed based on the information islands in the smart construction of various fields in smart cities. The smart environment monitoring, smart transportation, and smart epidemic prevention at the application layer of the SCI system are designed separately. A multi-objective optimization algorithm for cloud computing virtual machine resource allocation method (CC-VMRA method) is proposed, and the application of the IoT and cloud computing technology in the smart city information system is further analysed and simulated for the performance verification. The results show that the multi-objective optimization algorithm in the CC-VMRA method can greatly reduce the number of physical servers in the SCI system (less than 20), and the variance is not higher than 0.0024, which can enable the server cluster to achieve better load balancing effects. In addition, the packet loss rate of the Zigbee protocol used by the IoT gateway in the SCI system is far below the 0.1\% indicator, and the delay is less than 10~ms. Therefore, the SCI system constructed by this study shows low latency and high utilization rate, which can provide experimental reference for the later construction of smart city.},

  abstract = {In the age of Big Data, efficient algorithms are now in higher demand more than ever before. While Big Data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by our pioneers, it also challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today’s problems. It is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. In this tutorial, I will survey a family of algorithmic techniques for the design of provably-good scalable algorithms. These techniques include local network exploration, advanced sampling, sparsification, and geometric partitioning. They also include spectral graph-theoretical methods, such as those used for computing electrical flows and sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields. These methods exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in network analysis. I will illustrate the use of these techniques by a few basic problems that are fundamental in network analysis, particularly for the identification of significant nodes and coherent clusters/communities in social and information networks. I also take this opportunity to discuss some frameworks beyond graph-theoretical models for studying conceptual questions to understand multifaceted network data that arise in social influence, network dynamics, and Internet economics.},

  abstract = {Vehicular CrowdSensing (VCS) has become a powerful sensing paradigm by selecting users driving vehicles to perform tasks. In most existing research, the platform centrally allocates tasks according to the collected user information. We argue that the information collection process results in user privacy leakage, and the centralized allocation leads to a heavy computation complexity. We propose to apply a distributed task allocation method in the widely-used route navigation system. The navigation system recommends several routes to a user and each route may cover some tasks. Then, the user distributively selects a route according to the route profit (task reward minus route cost). Since the task reward is shared by users, the route selections of users may influence each other. Hence, it remains unclear how to design a distributed route navigation approach to reach an equilibrium state (i.e., each user is satisfied with the selected route), while guaranteeing a good total profit. To this end, we formulate the problem as a multi-user potential game and propose a distributed route navigation algorithm. The trace-based simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves a Nash equilibrium, while achieving a total user profit performance close to that of the optimal solution.},

  abstract = {With the development of the Internet and the informatization construction of universities, the massive data accumulated by “campus big data” presents problems such as discreteness and sparseness. Students with abnormal behaviors have become an urgent problem to be solved in student behavior analysis. This paper proposes an early warning method for abnormal behaviour of college students based on multimodal fusion and an improved decision tree (EWMABCS-MFIDT). First, given the insufficient representation of student behavioral portraits and the problems of timeliness and dynamics in behavioral labels, a student behavioral portrait based on the multimodal fusion method is proposed. Second, aiming at the timeliness and backwardness of abnormal behavior prediction, based on student behavior classification prediction, this paper proposes an improved decision tree-based early warning method for abnormal student behavior. Finally, we design a student behavior analysis and early warning framework under the campus big data environment. Taking the abnormal early warning of students’ academic performance as an example, compared with other early warning algorithms, the EWMABCS-MFIDT method can improve the accuracy of early warning and make students’ educational work more targeted, personalized, and predictive.}

  abstract = {The OMG standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has been on the market for about thirteen years. This standard is an extended subset of UML providing a graphical modeling language for designing complex systems by considering software as well as hardware parts. Over the period of thirteen years, many publications have covered various aspects of SysML in different research fields. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic mapping study about SysML to identify the different categories of papers, (i) to get an overview of existing research topics and groups, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to uncover possible missing links. We followed the guidelines for conducting a systematic mapping study by Petersen et al. (Inf Softw Technol 64:1–18, 2015) to analyze SysML publications from 2005 to 2017. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest in SysML in the last years particularly in the research field of Software Engineering, (ii) SysML is mostly used in the design or validation phase, rather than in the implementation phase, (iii) the most commonly used diagram types are the SysML-specific requirement diagram, parametric diagram, and block diagram, together with the activity diagram and state machine diagram known from UML, (iv) SysML is a specific UML profile mostly used in systems engineering; however, the language has to be customized to accommodate domain-specific aspects, (v) related to collaborations for SysML research over the world, there are more individual research groups than large international networks. This study provides a solid basis for classifying existing approaches for SysML. Researchers can use our results (i) for identifying open research issues, (ii) for a better understanding of the state of the art, and (iii) as a reference for finding specific approaches about SysML.},

This article aims to study the financial self-service transaction method based on a wireless communication network. This article starts from three stages such as functional planning, future direction, and final management and makes every effort to help the bank focus on three-dimensional and intelligent development of main business channel services from three levels such as technology, facilities, and channels, so as to realize the banking business from “production and direction” to “the transformation of marketing and experience,” providing end users with a brand-new work experience at anytime and anywhere to increase productivity and reduce labor costs. The research results show that more than 80\% of the interviewed people have expressed affirmation of the financial self-service transaction service under the wireless communication network, and the interactive design of the operation interface and the information data and security system need to be further improved.},

  abstract = {A distributed video-on-demand system~(DVoD) with multiple server-nodes is a cost-effective and fault-tolerant solution for a high scalable enterprise video-on-demand (VoD) system. However, such a server-oriented design is highly vulnerable to workload variations given that the service capacity is limited. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) has been introduced as an architectural solution with self-growing capacity. However, the characteristics of a pure P2P system such as the peer transient nature and high network overhead make this kind of architecture unsuitable for a fully interactive VoD system. In this paper, we propose a new efficient integrated VoD architecture, called DPn2Pm, that combines DVoD with a P2P system and multicast communications. The DVoD’s server-nodes provide a minimum required quality of service (QoS) and the P2P system is able to offer the mechanism to increase the system service capacity according to client demands. Multicast communication, wherever it is possible, is effectively exploited by our P2P system. In our design, each client is able to send video information to a set of m clients using only one multicast channel. Furthermore, the collaboration mechanism is able to coordinate a set of clients to create one collaboration group to replace the server, providing an extensive, efficient and low network-overhead collaboration mechanism from n-peers to m-peers. Regardless of the video the client is watching, our P2P scheme allows every active client to collaborate with the server. The P2P scheme is complemented with recovery mechanisms that are able to replace the failed client before affecting the QoS, offering continuous playback. The proposed approach has been broadly evaluated, firstly using a mathematical model to derive the theoretical performance and secondly using a simulation environment to analyze the system’s dynamic behavior, the VCR interaction impact and the client failures. Comparing DPn2Pm with other DVoD architectures and the most relevant P2P delivery policies, we show that our design is an improvement on previous solutions, providing a higher scalability.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has gained popularity in recent years, but with its rise comes concerns about data security. Unauthorized access and attacks on cloud-based data, applications, and infrastructure are major challenges that must be addressed. While machine learning algorithms have improved intrusion detection systems in cloud data security, they often fail to consider the entire life cycle of file processing, making it difficult to detect certain issues, especially insider attacks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing data file processing in multi-cloud environments using process mining. By generating a complete file processing event log from a multi-cloud environment, the proposed approach enables detection from both control flow and performance perspectives, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying file processing in its full life cycle. Through our case study, we demonstrate the power and capabilities of process mining for file security detection and showcase its ability to provide further insights into file security in multi-cloud environments.},
