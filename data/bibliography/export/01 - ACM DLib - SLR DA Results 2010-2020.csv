It is a survey paper that takes a different look at problems involving latency, bandwidth, cache-miss ratios, and the efficiency of parallel numerical algorithms. The Pi Theorem is the fundamental tool of dimensional analysis, and it applies to problems in computer performance analysis just as well as it does to problems in other sciences. Applying it requires the definition of a system of measurement appropriate for computer performance analysis with a consistent set of units and dimensions. Then a straightforward recipe for each specific problem reduces the number of independent variables to a smaller number of dimensionless parameters. Two machines with the same values of these parameters are self-similar and behave the same way. Self-similarity relationships emphasize how machines are the same rather than how they are different. The Pi Theorem is simple to state and simple to prove, using purely algebraic methods, but the results that follow from it are often surprising and not simple at all. The results are often unexpected but they almost always reveal something new about the problem at hand.","2014-02-01","2023-03-04 21:11:31","2025-07-09 03:54:25","2023-03-04 21:11:31","45–71","","1","29","","Comput.

However, such a server-oriented design is highly vulnerable to workload variations given that the service capacity is limited. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) has been introduced as an architectural solution with self-growing capacity. However, the characteristics of a pure P2P system such as the peer transient nature and high network overhead make this kind of architecture unsuitable for a fully interactive VoD system. In this paper, we propose a new efficient integrated VoD architecture, called DPn2Pm, that combines DVoD with a P2P system and multicast communications. The DVoD’s server-nodes provide a minimum required quality of service (QoS) and the P2P system is able to offer the mechanism to increase the system service capacity according to client demands. Multicast communication, wherever it is possible, is effectively exploited by our P2P system. In our design, each client is able to send video information to a set of m clients using only one multicast channel. Furthermore, the collaboration mechanism is able to coordinate a set of clients to create one collaboration group to replace the server, providing an extensive, efficient and low network-overhead collaboration mechanism from n-peers to m-peers. Regardless of the video the client is watching, our P2P scheme allows every active client to collaborate with the server. The P2P scheme is complemented with recovery mechanisms that are able to replace the failed client before affecting the QoS, offering continuous playback. The proposed approach has been broadly evaluated, firstly using a mathematical model to derive the theoretical performance and secondly using a simulation environment to analyze the system’s dynamic behavior, the VCR interaction impact and the client failures. Comparing DPn2Pm with other DVoD architectures and the most relevant P2P delivery policies, we show that our design is an improvement on previous solutions, providing a higher scalability.","2010-12-01","2024-07-16 03:12:37","2025-07-09 02:33:47","","1175-1192","","12","70","","Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\E5CPS55F\Yang et al. - 2010 - Designing an effective P2P system for a VoD system.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220378500_Designing_an_effective_P2P_system_for_a_VoD_system_to_exploit_the_multicast_communication","Content delivery network; Distributed VoD; Multicast; P2P; Proxy; Video-on-demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those who must perform analysis directly on low-level National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 1B calibrated and geolocated data, for example, encounter an arcane, high-volume data set that is burdensome to make use of. Instead, Earth scientists typically opt to use higher-level ""canned"" products provided by NASA. However, when these higher-level products fail to meet the requirements of a particular project, a cruel dilemma arises: cope with data products that don't exactly meet the project's needs or spend an enormous amount of resources extracting what is needed from the unadulterated low-level data. In this paper, we present EarthDB, a system that eliminates this dilemma by offering the following contributions:1. Enabling painless importing of MODIS Level 1B data into SciDB, a highly scalable science-oriented database platform that abstracts away the complexity of distributed storage and analysis of complex multi-dimensional data,2.

The model was developed based on a 12-month extensive field measurement at Sg. Bernam. This study established the governing factors and derived dependent and independent variables for riverbank erosion using dimensional analysis, based on the Buckingham PI theorem. Two functional relationships were derived from dimensional analysis incorporating the factors governing riverbank erosion. The functional relationships include parameters of hydraulic characteristics of the channel, riverbank geometry and soil characteristics. Parameter estimation was conducted using a linear least squares technique to quantify riverbank erosion rates. The significant independent variables and fourteen models with several numbers of hidden layers were set as the input parameters to the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model performance analysis shows that Models 1 and 9, developed based on the proposed NARX-QR Factorization model, have the highest R2 at 75% and 91%, respectively. Model 1 performed the best with accuracies for training and testing datasets of 75% and 73%, respectively. Additionally, the scatter plot of Model 1 is uniformly distributed along the line of perfect agreement.

In order to increase the fidelity of the model obtained by regression, the DoE needs to optimally cover the dimensionless space. However, in order to generate the data for the regression, one still needs a DoE for the physical variables, in order to carry out the simulations. Thus, there exist two spaces, each one needing a DoE. Since the dimensionless space is always smaller than the physical one, the challenge for building a DoE is that the relation between the two spaces is not bijective. Moreover, each space usually has its own domain constraints, which renders them not-surjective. This means that it is impossible to design the DoE in one space and then automatically generate the corresponding DoE in the other space while satisfying the constraints from both spaces. The solution proposed in the paper transforms the computation of the DoE into an optimization problem formulated in terms of a space-filling criterion (maximizing the minimum distance between neighboring points). An approach is proposed for efficiently solving this optimization problem in a two steps procedure. The method is particularly well suited for building surrogates in terms of dimensionless variables spanning several orders of magnitude (e.g. power laws). The paper also proposes some variations of the method; one when more control is needed on the number of levels on each non-dimensional variable and another one when a good distribution of the DoE is desired in the logarithmic scale. The DoE construction method is illustrated on three case studies. A purely numerical case illustrates each step of the method and two other, mechanical and thermal, case studies illustrate the results in different configurations and different practical aspects.","2017-09-01","2024-07-16 05:56:17","2025-07-09 02:07:47","2024-07-16 05:56:16","663-679","","3","56","","Struct Multidisc Optim","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\6EBCZDW3\Hazyuk et al. - 2017 - Optimal design of computer experiments for surroga.pdf; C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\V39P9DJI\Hazyuk et al. - 2017 - Optimal design of computer experiments for surrogate models with dimensionless variables.pdf; C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\DUJDR5BN\Hazyuk et al. - 2017 - Optimal design of computer experiments for surrogate models with dimensionless variables.pdf","","Dimensional analysis; Non-dimensional variables; Optimal space filling; Optimization with space transformation; Surrogate modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an extension of the conventional terramechanics theory for terrestrial vehicles, the terramechanics theory for planetary rovers, which is becoming a new research hotspot, is unique and puts forward many new challenging problems. This paper first discusses the significance of the study of wheel–soil interaction mechanics of planetary rovers and summarizes the differences between planetary rovers and terrestrial vehicles and the problems arising thereof. The application of terramechanics to the development of planetary rovers can be divided into two phases (the R&D phase and exploration phase for rovers) corresponding to the high-fidelity and simplified terramechanics models. This paper also describes the current research status by providing an introduction to classical terramechanics and the experimental, theoretical, and numerical researches on terramechanics for planetary rovers. The application status of the terramechanics for planetary rovers is analyzed from the aspects of rover design, performance evaluation, planetary soil parameter identification, dynamics simulation, mobility control, and path planning. Finally, the key issues for future research are discussed. The current planetary rovers are actually advanced wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), developed employing cutting-edge technologies from different fields. The terramechanics for planetary rovers is expected to present new challenges and applications for WMRs, making it possible to develop WMRs using the concepts of mechanics and dynamics.","2011-01-01","2024-07-16 05:57:45","2025-07-09 03:55:03","2024-07-16 05:57:43","17-38","","1","4","","Intel Serv Robotics","Planetary rovers’ wheel–soil interaction mechanics","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\C7NSK837\Ding et al. - 2011 - Planetary rovers’ wheel–soil interaction mechanics.pdf","","Control; Terramechanics; Planetary rover; Design and performance evaluation; Dynamics simulation; Soil parameter identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our ongoing project, called SOPHRA, in collaboration with the City Hospital in Saskatoon, Canada, focuses on supporting care providers (e.g., physicians) in the collection/recording of medical data from patients remotely. A major challenge that needs to be addressed is the potential loss of communication between the mobile-clients and the health information system (HIS) during the transfer of the electronic health record (EHR). Overcoming this challenge will foster soft-real time medical data exchanges. However, the issue of communication loss can be as a result of the over-reliance on wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, which can sometimes be unstable. Thus, the goal of this work is to propose a mobile health (mHealth) architectural environment that can exploit the limited available bandwidth during the mobile medical data transfer.

In order to balance the checkpointing overhead and the loss of computation on recovery, the authors propose a hybrid checkpointing algorithm, wherein an all-process coordinated checkpoint is taken after the execution of minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm for a fixed number of times. In coordinated checkpointing, if a single process fails to take its checkpoint; all the checkpointing effort goes waste, because, each process has to abort its tentative checkpoint. In order to take the tentative checkpoint, an MH Mobile Host needs to transfer large checkpoint data to its local MSS over wireless channels. In this regard, the authors propose that in the first phase, all concerned MHs will take soft checkpoint only. Soft checkpoint is similar to mutable checkpoint. In this case, if some process fails to take checkpoint in the first phase, then MHs need to abort their soft checkpoints only. The effort of taking a soft checkpoint is negligibly small as compared to the tentative one.

The on-line detection of them from large position streams of mobile entities is a challenging task because it requires algorithms that are capable of continuously and efficiently processing the high volume of position updates in a timely manner. Currently, the majority of approaches for cluster detection operate in batch mode, where position updates are recorded during time periods of certain length and then batch processed by an external routine, thus delaying the result of the cluster detection until the end of the time period. However, if the monitoring application requires results at a higher frequency than the one delivered by batch algorithms, then results might not reflect the current clustering state of the entities. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose DG2CEP, an algorithm that combines the well-known density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN with the data stream processing paradigm Complex Event Processing (CEP) to achieve continuous, on-line detection of clusters. Our experiments with synthetic and real world datasets indicate that DG2CEP is able to detect the formation and dispersion of clusters with small latency and higher similarity to DBSCAN's output than batch-based approaches. HighlightsWe present an on-line algorithm (DG2CEP) for clustering position data streams.DG2CEP combines data stream mining with complex event processing concepts.DG2CEP can detect both the formation and the dispersion of clusters as data pass.Experimental results demonstrate that DG2CEP can rapidly detect cluster formations.Experiments also show that DG2CEP results are highly similar to off-line approaches (DBSCAN).","2017-03","2024-07-16 21:27:11","2025-07-09 02:40:52","","303–320","","C","64","","Inf.

While Big Data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by our pioneers, it also challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today’s problems. It is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. In this tutorial, I will survey a family of algorithmic techniques for the design of provably-good scalable algorithms. These techniques include local network exploration, advanced sampling, sparsification, and geometric partitioning. They also include spectral graph-theoretical methods, such as those used for computing electrical flows and sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields. These methods exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in network analysis. I will illustrate the use of these techniques by a few basic problems that are fundamental in network analysis, particularly for the identification of significant nodes and coherent clusters/communities in social and information networks. I also take this opportunity to discuss some frameworks beyond graph-theoretical models for studying conceptual questions to understand multifaceted network data that arise in social influence, network dynamics, and Internet economics.","2016-05","2024-07-16 21:27:11","2025-07-09 02:40:54","","1–274","","1–2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number of pages: 278 Place: Hanover, MA, USA Publisher: Now Publishers Inc. tex.issue_date: May 2016","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, much of that energy is wasted to maintain excess service capacity during periods of low load.

In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics. Solving this model, we notice that there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption and performance. We hereby develop a BFGS based algorithm to optimize the tradeoff by searching for the optimal system parameter values for the data center operators to “right-size” the data centers. We implement our Stochastic Right-sizing Model (SRM) and deploy it in the real-world cloud data center.

Aiming to offer a computational alternative for helping in detection of nodules, serving as a second opinion to the specialists, this work proposes a totally automatic methodology based on successive detection refining stages. The automated lung nodules detection scheme consists of six stages: thorax extraction, lung extraction, lung reconstruction, structures extraction, tubular structures elimination, and false positive reduction. In the thorax extraction stage all the artifacts external to the patient’s body are discarded. Lung extraction stage is responsible for the identification of the lung parenchyma. The objective of the lung reconstruction stage is to prevent incorrect elimination of portions belonging to the parenchyma. Structures extraction stage comprises the selection of dense structures from inside the lung parenchyma. The next stage, tubular structures elimination eliminates a great part of the pulmonary trees. Finally, the false positive stage selects only structures with great probability to be nodule. Each of the several stages has very specific objectives in detection of particular cases of lung nodules, ensuring good matching rates even in difficult detection situations. We use 33 exams with diversified diagnosis and slices numbers for validating the methodology. We obtained a false positive per exam rate of 0.42 and false negative rate of 0.15. The total classification sensitivity obtained, measured out of the nodule candidates, was 84.84%.

Based on personal experience of ski teaching, ski training and ski competing, we have noticed that some gaps exist between classical models describing body-techniques and actual motor acts made by performing athletes. The evolution of new parabolic shaped skis with new mechanical and geometric characteristics increase these differences even more. Generally, scientific research focuses on situations where skiers are separated from their skis. Also, many specialized magazines, handbooks and papers print articles with similar epistemology. In this paper, we describe the development of a three-dimensional analysis to model the skier-skis' system. We subsequently used the model to propose an evaluation template to coaches that includes eight techniques and three observable consequences in order to make objective evaluations of their athletes' body-techniques. Once the system is modeled, we can develop a computer simulation in the form of a jumping jack, respecting degrees of freedom of the model. We can manipulate movement of each body segment or skis' gears' characteristics to detect performance variations. The purpose of this project is to elaborate assumptions to improve performance and propose experimental protocols to coaches to enable them to evaluate performance. This computer simulation also involves board and wheeled sports.Methods. Eleven elite alpine skiers participated. Video cameras were used to observe motor acts in alpine skiers in two tasks: slalom and giant slalom turns. Kinematic data were input into the 3D Vision software. Two on-board balances were used to measure the six components of ski-boots→skis torques. All data sources were then synchronized.Findings. We found correlations between force and torque measurements, the progression of center of pressure and the eight body-techniques. Based on these results, we created a technological model of the skier-ski system. Then, we have made a reading template and a model to coach young alpine skiers in clubs and world cup alpine skiers and, we have obtained results demonstrating the usefulness of our research.Interpretation. These results suggest that it is now possible to create a three-dimensional simulator of an alpine skier. This tool is able to compare competitors' body-techniques to detect the most performing body-techniques. Additionally, it is potentially helpful to consider and evaluate new techniques and ski characteristics.","2010-04-02","2025-07-09 01:22:50","2025-07-09 02:07:52","2025-07-08","1–7","","","","","","","AH '10","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\37M8SZPU\Roux et al. - 2010 - Skier-ski system model and development of a computer simulation aiming to improve skier's performanc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have created a vision-based human locomotion laboratory to capture the healthy and non-healthy gait patterns. A low cost black uniform is taken to capture different person's gait data. This dress is made up with a piece of multiple color ribbon to identify different locations of body joints. It provides an added advantage during separation of different joint locations through color-based segmentation method. The demographic information of each subject helps to understand their gait dynamics. It instigates us to build a musculo-skeletal gait model on OpenSim simulation framework.

In TB bacilli identification, specimens are stained using Ziehl–Neelsen or Auramine dye&nbsp;and are examined by technicians thoroughly for any infectious microbes. For pathological study, the images of these microbes are captured using microscopes and image processing is applied for further analysis. However, choosing 100 field of views (FOV) randomly from a 2 × 1&nbsp;cm square area of sputum specimen may lead to inconsistency in specificity. The examination of specimens is a tedious process, and it requires especially skilled technicians for screening the sputum smear samples. The proposed tuberculosis detection system consists of two subsystems—a data acquisition system and a recognition system. In the data acquisition system, a motorized microscopic stage is designed and developed to automate the acquisition of all FOVs. Here the microscopic stage movement is motorized and scanning patterns are defined by the user for specimen examination. After the acquisition of all FOVs, data are passed to the recognition system. In the recognition system, transfer learning method is implemented by customizing the Inception V3 DeepNet model. This model learns from the pre-trained weights of Inception V3 and classifies the data using support vector machine (SVM) from the transferred knowledge. For training and testing the customized Inception V3 model, a public TB dataset (Shah et al. in J Med Imaging 4(2):027503, 2017. https://doi-org.ezproxy.uniandes.edu.co/10.1117/1.jmi.4.2.027503) and our own acquired microscopic digital dataset are used for analysis. In this&nbsp;model, the fixed feature representations are taken from the top stack layer of Inception V3 DeepNet and are classified using SVM. This model attains an accuracy of 95.05%, thereby reducing the dependency on skilled technicians in the screening process and increasing sensitivity and specificity.","2019-05-01","2025-07-09 01:25:17","2025-07-09 03:53:55","2025-07-09 01:25:17","1533–1545","","5","31","","","RETRACTED ARTICLE","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current methodologies do not offer embodied workflows that utilize the feedback obtained through a subsequent transition process between physical and digital design. Therefore, narrowing the separation between these two platforms remains as a research problem. This literature review elaborates the divide between physical and digital design, testing and manufacturing techniques in the morphological process of architectural form. We first review the digital transformation in the architectural design discourse. Then, we proceed by introducing a variety of methods that are integrating digital and physical workflows and suggesting an alternative approach. Our work unveils that there is a need for empirical research with a focus on integrated approaches to create intuitively embodied experiences for architectural designers.","2019-05-02","2025-07-09 01:25:27","2025-07-09 02:33:37","2025-07-08","1–15","","","","","","Integrated Workflows","CHI '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\QEPJUY7L\Gulay and Lucero - 2019 - Integrated Workflows Generating Feedback Between Digital and Physical Realms.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the main objectives of the FAIRMODE activities is the development of a procedure for the evaluation and benchmarking of air quality modelling applications for regulatory purposes. The DELTA Tool is a specific software which provides summary statistics (i.e. BIAS, RMSE, correlation coefficient) as well as scatter-plots, time series plots, Taylor, Target and other diagrams providing an overview of the quality of model results with respect to monitored data. Moreover, the benchmarking service implemented in DELTA produces summary reports containing performance indicators related to a given model application in the frame of the EU Air Quality Directive (AQD, 2008). This work describes the structure of the DELTA tool and template for reporting model performances.

A quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic solver is developed and connected to a finite beam element model for wing aerostructural optimization. In a quasi-three-dimensional approach an inviscid incompressible vortex lattice method is coupled with a viscous compressible airfoil analysis code for drag prediction of a three dimensional wing. The accuracy of the proposed method for wing drag prediction is validated by comparing its results with the results of a higher fidelity CFD analysis. The wing structural deformation as well as the stress distribution in the wingbox structure is computed using a finite beam element model. The Newton method is used to solve the coupled system. The sensitivities of the outputs, for example the wing drag, with respect to the inputs, for example the wing geometry, is computed by a combined use of the coupled adjoint method, automatic differentiation and the chain rule of differentiation. A gradient based optimization is performed using the proposed tool for minimizing the fuel weight of an A320 class aircraft. The optimization resulted in more than 10 % reduction in the aircraft fuel weight by optimizing the wing planform and airfoils shape as well as the wing internal structure.","2016-10-01","2025-07-09 01:29:09","2025-07-11 02:40:05","2025-07-09 01:29:09","889–906","","4","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\6MJPVGKW\Elham and Tooren - 2016 - Coupled adjoint aerostructural wing optimization using quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic analysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are a lot of effective pre-computation methods of data cube. But in practice, appropriate pre-computation method for the characteristics of data set plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of data cube pre-computation.In view of the high-dimensional and hierarchical dimension of water census data characteristic, Frag-Shells cube based on hierarchical dimension encoding tree has been proposed in this paper. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency and reduce redundant information in hierarchical dimensions, we have proposed hierarchical dimension encoding tree (HDE-Tree) to index the hierarchical dimension in Frag-Shells cube. In order to increase the efficiency of cube construction, improved Frag-Shells cube calculation method has been used to compute the tuples of non-hierarchical dimension fragments. In order to compress the size of data cube, the TID-List compression method has been used to decrease the storage cost of inverted index in each tuple. Experiments show that the Frag-Shells cube based on hierarchical dimension encoding tree can reduce the construction time and storage cost of data cube which has high-dimensional and dimensions hierarchical figures.","2017-01-05","2025-07-09 01:29:30","2025-07-09 02:40:53","2025-07-08","1–9","","","","","","","IMCOM '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Felipe\Zotero\storage\XTFF9YTZ\Tang et al. - 2017 - Frag-shells cube based on hierarchical dimension encoding tree.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are very effective for conveying dry particulate solids, giving good control over the throughput. Despite their apparent simplicity, the transportation action is very complex and designers have tended to rely heavily on empirical performance data. Intelligent operation parameters optimisation for screw conveyor based on PSO is studied in this paper. This thesis takes a heavy driving drum of screw conveyor as an example, firstly, the optimisation function is built up, then the operation parameter of screw conveyor is precision optimised with PSO algorithm, which offer a foundation to design more reasonable structure for driving drum in order to meet the application demands.","2011-08-01","2025-07-09 01:30:01","2025-07-09 02:40:56","2025-07-09 01:30:01","169–176","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
